"I ordered this Apple Pencil in anticipation for my new IPad Air 4 back in March 2021. It was marked as “new”, I paid full price ($130). It worked fantastically for most of the next 17 months. When the pencil was not in my hand, it was attached to the side of my iPad Air 4. It kept a 100% charge all the time when I wasn’t using it. I draw in Procreate, Illustrator, and Photoshop and I am an avid note taker so I’m always aware of the battery level of both devices.I always plugged my iPad in every night to charge or at my desk first thing in the morning while I worked. I always checked the Pencil. If it was ever detached for whatever reason, I connected it and observed it was at or near 100% every time. A few minutes later it was back to a full charge.Fast forward to August 2022.  The Apple Pencil suddenly stopped charging. Over the next few days, it failed to charge and died for the first time. It would intermittently charge. Every few days, it appeared to charge to 100% and seemed to be fine. A few days of sporadic use I would notice the Apple Pencil was not charging (I still kept the Pencil attached and the iPad charged). Then magically it would charge again after forgetting the Pencil and reconnecting several times. Then it would sporadically not maintain a charge.I was busy with a lot of important projects during this time so this was low priority in my life. Finally at the last week of September it refused to charge at all. It would charge enough to connect via Bluetooth (only briefly) then disconnect.I took it and my iPad to the local Best Buy (an Apple Authorized Service Provider) and they diagnosed it with a bad battery that would not charge. The tech asked me when I purchased the Pencil and I indicated “March 2021” so he was checking for any warranty that may be active. He checked the Serial Number against an Apple database and told me it was originally purchased in January 2021.I bought a new Pencil and got a used Pencil? It seemed to work fine for over a year. But I’m left wondering why it suddenly stopped charging? What could’ve been wrong with it to have the Pencil last for so long then stop working? Are Apple Pencils notorious for just not being a good product?Granted, I had the device for one year and a number of months but I did not expect it to crap out on me so quickly. I have a 15 year old Wacom stylus and tablet that still work. I have an iPhone 6S Max that still works (not my daily driver, but still). My 37 year old NES works like it’s 1985. I take great care of my technology.I took care of it and followed the directions (especially didn’t get it wet or feed it after midnight). I took it on vacation this summer and it stayed in the room. Not even around water or sand. Yet here was a $130 aluminum and plastic stick that was useless. Like a fool, I did not purchase an Apple Care plan for the Pencil (my mistake). And it was apparently used when I bought it. Amazon lied.I spent $130 on another one at Best Buy that day (much to the chagrin from my wife) and I shouldn’t have had to do that. I could see if I treated it poorly and did not keep it charged but that was not the case.Amazon sold me a used Pencil that may have had a defect. I double checked my order to make sure I did not buy a refurbished or used Pencil (I did not). And since it worked for almost 18 months…probably nothing I can do.",,
"Overall it’s a great stylus just as one would expect from apple. Good response, I like the double tap feature and it charges fast. However, I use a textured screen protector and draw a lot. After about a month and a half the tip of mine has been ground down to wear I can see metal. Since I don’t want to buy a new tip all the time I’m getting third party metal ones. I would like to mention that I have some dexterity issues and as a result put a lot of pressure on my pencils, in addition, because it is pressure sensitive if I want to use that feature while drawing I sometimes have to press harder which I’m sure has degraded it further. Overall it’s great but the tip thing really sucks.",,
"I am sure the Apple Pencil is nice, but beware that if you have a big rugged case on your iPad (as mandated by my daughter's school) the Pencil is basically worthless. Every time my daughter needs to charge the pencil or use it, she needs to take the case off her iPad, which is a big ordeal. And even if you buy an external charger, it doesn't work because you have to touch the pencil to the iPad charge pad to sync it. This is the most poorly designed Apple product I have ever seen for students. You are better off buying the Generation 1 Pencil or a cheaper third-party version.",,
"If you have 2017, 5th gen iPad or older Apple says the 2nd gen pencil doesn't work with those iPads. I've read it's because the hardware in older iPads isn't compatible with the 2nd gen pencil.  My old pen still works with an old (and cracked) iPad. So I guess that's something, BUT minus stars for changing technologies and making you have buy something you already own because it's too old. (I know I know, this shouldn't be a surprise to me. And it's not. Just disappointed.)",,
Listing says only packaging will be damaged. The pencil had a chip at the top and gunk residue by the logo. Haven’t tested the performance but just upset it came out looking “good” instead of “like new”,,
Its good build quality as is always the case with Apple. But pricy. For my purposes this is useless. I guess if I purchased some art apps and all the modules that cost extra. I might use it. Handwriting with it is not as natural as a pen or pencil. Wish I hadn’t purchased it,,
"I needed to change the pencil tip. I unscrewed the one that came on the pencil, no problem. Couldn’t get the others on. Upon closer examination, the tip on the pencil had inside threads and is smaller than the extra tips. The extra tips have threads on the outside. Included a pic of the box, I’m guessing Amazon makes their pencils in China but I now have a useless pencil and I need it.",,
accuracy is bad I believe because it came with a bad tip. Disappointed.,,
Worked well for a few months then stopped charging. Went to apple and found out I was sold a pencil out of warranty. So they won’t even replace it.,,
"I was loving my pencil until it stopped working all of a sudden. It would show that it’s connected to Bluetooth and fully charged, but it was not working on my iPad Pro at all. I didn’t drop it or damage it in anyway. I even had a nice little protective cover on it (which I took off to make sure it wasn’t the issue). I tried taking the nib off and replacing it (there was no gap), forgetting the device and reconnecting it to Bluetooth, and even rebooting my iPad… nothing remedied my issue. Luckily this occurred within a couple weeks of ordering it . I’m currently awaiting a replacement. This is still a major bummer . Will update if this happens again.",,
It won’t work on my iPad.,,
"I just returned my second Apple Pencil in the past six weeks. My first pencil only lasted three weeks before it stopped connecting to my iPad. I took it to the Genius Bar and it was determined the device was defective. I returned the pencil to Amazon and received a replacement. Three weeks after receiving the new pencil, it too stopped connecting to my iPad. I took it back to the Genius Bar and once again the device was defective. So, I’m now on my third Apple Pencil in hopes that the third time will be a charm.",,
"I truly enjoy the apple pencil, but after having mine for only a couple months, it is broken. Be careful not to drop it while using it because it will break like a cheap glass.",,
I see an image of the pencil but nothing connect or no battery % appers. I have IPad Air 5th gen and it’s supposed to be so easy,,
"I feel a little upset. I bought a brand new one, however, the box is not sealed, anyone can easily slide it out and put it back, the very tip of my pencil looks shiny like it was used before.",,
It worked fine for 1 month then stopped connecting. Now it doesn’t connect and barely charges when it can connect.,,
"I am writting this to inform anyone that has purchased product to go ahead and jot down the serial number ASAP because if you have issues, you will need this number for support. I purchased this on July 9th last year and it died on me and when I took to Apple for warranty and replacement, I did not have available and was lost in the iPad. They would not honor because in their system, it stated I bought up a month earlier and warranty is expired. The SN is in the weirdest place on the pencil. It is on the tip and you have to take the cover off to see it if you can because it is so microscopic. Good luck and hope this helps someone.",,
Not on point,,
"I was honestly a little disappointed, I feel like I have been robbed. But before I give my bad review I would say that I appreciated that I have an apple pencil in my box. Also, I liked that the apple pencil worked. However, I would say that I thought that I was given a new version of the apple pencil, why do I say this? because the one that I got, looked like it was used. In the pictures, you will see that the apple pencil has dents. In the beginning, I said that I felt robbed because I saw that there were different ""buying options"" I only saw one option, which said it was ""new"" but I got the opposite. I will say for what I got the price was high. Aside from that issue, the apple pencil worked, it connected with the magnet and I can write with it.",,
"When I got my pencil the box was ripped, I’m missing my extra tip and the plastic wrap around the pencil had hair and dirt stuck to it. Makes me feel like my pencil was used.",,
"I bought it on May31 and today, sept 31, simply Stopped working.",,
"Bought this in March 2019 along with an iPad Pro.  Both items were sold by Amazon as ""new.""  This past week the pencil died.  No big deal, there's a one year warranty.  However, Apple informed me that the warranty on my pencil's serial number expired already.  The Apple warranty department is reviewing this as I was able to produce an Amazon receipt showing that Amazon sold this to me as ""new"", but they told me this was not the first time they've seen this.  I think for me, this is the final straw with Amazon, coupled with reports of them banning books based on political viewpoints, I'm done giving Amazon my Prime money.  As for the pencil, it makes using the iPad easier, but shame on Apple for milking $130 from people for something that should cost no more than $50.  Incidentally, we checked the serial number on the iPad.  At least Amazon got that right.",,
"A: Write with it, store it, and drop it.Q: What are the 3 most common things people do with a pen or pencil?  Apple got 2 out of 3 right on the Apple Pencil. Unfortunately, at $129 a pop, the outside casing is a concern. Don't drop it on a hard surface, ceramic tile for one, because the pretty white outside can crack and probably will. Mine did in two places. The crack starts out as a hairline fracture, looking almost like someone scribbled a small line with a #2 lead pencil. Eventually, it spreads both in length and width so it forms a ridge. My pencil was not 90 days old when this happened.  Shame on Apple engineers. Pencils. Write, store, drop. We do all three, the first two intentionally. Dropping is done accidentally. At $129 they need to be designed to do all 3 well. The current material choice is too brittle and unforgiving.  Apple can do better, and should do better. Until then, buyer beware and check out alternatives. When this one stops working I will not replace it with an Apple Pencil. If you do buy one, don't drop it.",,
"The pencil is a great product and is a game changer for people who use it like I do, reading a ton of music every day and marking scores. But one single drop on the floor during a rehearsal broke both the tip and the sensor off, and there is no way to repair it. The only thing to do is replace it, but the cost makes that a hard pill to swallow. I will be seeking an alternative solution.",,
"Lasted couple weeks. Quit working, needed replacement",,
"I bought a defective Apple Pencil probably for about $100. It worked until the first charge ran out and then it refused to charge. I was busy so I didn't call apple support until I owned the pencil for about 3 weeks. They talked me thru resetting it, and it charged. But it only worked for about a week. Amazon offers no return on defective Apple products - you are sent to Apple support who doesn't care how much time you have to spend talking to them to fix the problem.And remember when you brought that apple product online because you were too busy to go into the store. Well if you are unlucky enough to buy a defective product you can make multiple trips to their apple store in 110+ degree weather. And what sad is they know the store can't even help you with the Apple pencils. The store cant do any trouble shooting that can not be done on the phone.Also If they are sending you to the apple store - make sure the store has one in stock. Because thats really all you are going to the store for. They did offer to replace it, all I have to do is make another trip to the store after they order it. Sorry, we can't ship it to you.Really a trip to the store to fix a problem with a brand new device is like paying for shipping when they send you something that is broken in the first placeI’ve spent time on 3 customer service calls and Apple support team sent me to an apple store in person. But the apple store can’t do anything else to troubleshoot apple pencils the the online person can. And on top of that they did not even have a replacement pencil which is what was clearly needed.I could have bought a new pencil myself for all of MY time apple has wasted trying to fix their defect.At this point, I’m entirely insulted by Apples total lack of respect for their customers time. This was supposed to be a brand new product. Not to mention Apple's waste of their own employees time, for the amount of time they paid their employees to give me the run around they could have paid for 2 pencils.I'm normally an Apple lover, but shame on Apple.",,
"For the life of me I can’t figure out why this is the slightest bit better than a $5 stylus.  It allows you some text entry options and it’s precise, but it has no utility for adjusting bush width mid stroke or selecting between colors or locating it when it gets lost or haptics or lights or….  The fact it is connected via Bluetooth is odd, it requires charging buy jutting out of a fragile charging port like a erection.  It’s just meh.  I’ve been using Mac exclusively since the IIci beige box era because their gear is rugged, super reliable, upgraded itself, and was always INTUITIVE.  So I’ve either become too old to figure this stuff out or this is just brand-fan-swag.  Not sure which, but hugely unimpressed.  That said my daughter is convinced this is the best thing ever but cannot explain why.  Getting old is an insult.  It’s a slap in the face.",,
Make sure that your device is compatible before buying.,,
Pen works great. On my 3rd one. Charge lasts okay. Accuracy is fine. Great with procreate.I hate the price. Absurdly overpriced for what it does. Other companies have better more useful pens for cheaper.,,
"WARNING: This does not turn into a stylist. It’s mainly for writing . Which is not ideal because when I stop writing and have to click an app or want to scroll through my home page screen it doesn’t work. Also, it charges by the side of the iPad and pretty fast, but my case does not allow it to be connected the side of the iPad all the time. So even if I fully charge it, and I don’t touch the pen for a few days, when I go to use it, it’s completely dead and I have to recharge it again. Not sure why it’s dying even though it’s not being used . None the less it’s very accurate with writing and great to take notes with the GOODNOTES app. It’s irritating trying to use it with the keyboard . If you’re not using it for note taking then it’s really worthless .",,
,,
"Good product, and overpriced",,
It had to be used... I didn't know the difference never owned an apple pen before... but I needed one quick. I had the money to get a customed one from apple directly which I would recommend. But I'm impatient. Wanted the same-day delivery and the small sale looked really tempting. I won't return it because it's not worth the hassle. I just had a nice little cover on it and it gets the job done. I don't see anything wrong with it mechanically so I'm keeping it. It's really good for my notetaking. BUT PLEASE JUST BUY ONE THAT U CAN CUSTOM DIRECTLY FROM APPLE. THE EXTRA 30 DOLLARS IS WORTH IT. don't fall for this...,,
"They literally design this thing to get lost. Which is what happened to me. No clip, “magnetic” charging…on a very loose connection…if you turn it backwards, it instantly falls off…For ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE BUCKS. Thank God I could expense a new one on the company card, or I’d never give Apple another penny for something like this.You know, they could have put a “pen cap” style clip to fasten it onto something…but, that wouldn’t serve their profit margin.As far as actual use, it works. No complaints.",,
"If you use Procreate, you will be able to understand if the pen have defects or not. The pen works well with all the other apps except Procreate. Ar first I thought this was a software issue. But after checking with my friends apple pen I am sure that this pen has some defects which will eventually cause issues in the future. So always test your pen in every possible functionality after buying to make sure it's alright.",,
Ok my old apple pen broken (after 6 months) so I bought a new one and the tip just god damaged like after 2 months. If this is really the apple pen then the tip is a low quality,,
"I dislike because around 3 month in it stopped working. Amazing shoves me to Apple.  Then they hold another $150 on your card untill you mail yours back.  Funds wrapped up for 3 weeks and no pen.  I highly recommend owning two of you need yours to work.  If you want faster exchange if it breaks, go to Apple store or Best buy.",,
This pencil is great for my tasks I need to complete on my tablet but unfortunately it’s true what other reviews are saying. It really lasts about a year before it totally craps out. I’ve had mine about a year and 2 weeks and I’ve been trouble shooting common problems and solutions but so far no luck.,,
I don't think this is a brand new apple pen. It won't connect to my tablet at all despite it saying its charged & my very first apple pen came with tip replacements. This one doesn't.,,
This expensive Apple Pencil survived one week before losing it while carry the iPad with the pencil magnetically attached from my car into a building. I noticed the loss within 30 minutes and backtracked my path and searched all around where I was seated but never found it. I know I had it at the car. In any case the magnetic feature is useful for charging but clearly not strong enough to carry the pencil mounted to the iPad. My next device will be one of the many clones.,,
The pen itself works amazing but the quality I received it in was not great. I've been using it for about a month and the nib is already worn down to the metal. And the nib is bent and I can't straighten it out.,,
"I really like this product as it helps with my drawings, but there's one downside to it, It keeps breaking my screen protecter, and every time it breaks the screen protecter it gives off such a creek, i don't know if it's supposed to be like that.",,
This product was a big disappointment. I ordered this as I had a new iPad coming however I had it along time before I got my iPad so haven’t used it in time to complain and send back. It has dead spots that don’t work. I’ll be drawing and if a certain part of the tip touches screen I get absolutely nothing. And have to keep turning the pencil till it works agin. Very frustrating for how expensive it is.,,
"The delivery was fine, I used this pen maybe like 2 or 3 times lol, I bought it in June, and it completely stopped working in July, like it’s always connected to my iPad, if the price was way lower I’d understand and buy a new one, but a Apple product at this price I expect way more durability and life. This has made me rethink how I view apple, they are not as superior as I once thought. 1 to 2 months and your $130 pencil will just stop working cold turkey. It’s clearly a cash grab by apple because this is not it lol. 2 stars because it at least worked for a limited and brief time.",,
Disappointed to get a used one with several weeks clocked off the warranty.,,
"El Apple Pencil no funcionaba, llegó con la batería dañada y no cargaba. Por suerte me lo cambiaron en la Apple Store",,
"had the first gen pencil with my little ipad, new ipad pro meant new pencil.  Love that it charges by magnetically attaching to the ipad.  Purchased a case with a spot for the pencil where it is still able to charge.  Only thing that I don't like is that it slips out of my hand so easily.  1st gen pencil didn't do that.  I'm completely bumfuzzled by it. Purchased a silicone grip for it, but it's so bulky that I had to take it on and off everytime I put the pencil away ... even though it could charge through the sillicone ... it was too bulky for the spot in the case.  argh.  Oh well ... and there are no extra tips like with the first gen.  That stunk. Sometimes the pencil glitches while using the lasso effect in goodnotes, so you have to repeatedly try.  It didn't glitch with my finger or a friends non-apple pencil ... soooo ... Otherwise, I'm pleased.  The pros far outweigh the cons and it's worth it.",,
"The pencil broke with a month. The tip broke off below the threads and the pencil deformed a little while trying to repair it. Crappy quality,  horrible customer service at Apple.",,
"Unfortunately this newer model $100 pencil is only compatible with certain iPads (not mine). Funny how you can buy any AirPods and pair them with literally anything, though. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning this item. I’m just gonna buy a $30 pen, it’ll do the same thing for it’s actual reasonable price.",,
"Don't make the same mistake I made, which was to use this without a screen protector on my brand new iPad. Within 30 minutes, my iPad screen was scratched beyond belief.The pencil itself is great, but you 100% need to protect your screen first.Hopefully this helps save someone the heartache I am currently experiencing!",,
This pen is way to heavy and requires charging very often. Apple has a way to go before they can match Samsung's S pen. Which feels just like a pen and doesn't require charging on a charging cable!!!,,
Very disappointed. Received a used pencil. There was no plastic on box and the box was even dirty. Ordered replacement. Hopefully it will be better. Gave 3 stars hoping the replacement will actually be new.,,
"Es realmente bueno lo que no me gusto es que su punta se desgasta demasiado pero su tecnología es realmente muy buena, pagas calidad, solo la punta falla.",,
"If there were competing products for this device, I would quickly consider them, but in evaluating knock-off replacements none of them had the featureset of this pen to even be considered in the realm of competitive. The biggest problem I have with this pen right now is that the battery does not last long enough because I can easily be drawing or writing for hours at a time. And gawd knows you need a case for your iPad, and all the available cases make keeping the pen charged impossible. I'm currently on the hunt for other ways to charge this pen; but damn they need to power this up. Why we need a bluetooth pen is beyond me, sure correction and palm rejection and all that, but come on there has to be a better low-powered way to do these things. Plus the pen for me is just way to dang thick, as I tend to prefer much finer writing utilites, I'm also struggling/learning to translate my style with a much larger tip. I don't like it, but that's just me. Also, at most the pen should priced about half as much as it is, it's current pricepoint just feels greedy. I'm hoping a knock-off can come and implement the features correctly, but I wont hold my breath.",,
"So the product works great, however I’ve already had to buy two of these because both of mine have died on me after only a few months of use. The nibs are fine, the batteries stayed charged, they weren’t dropped or anything like that but both of them have crapped out on me. I use my  iPad for art, so these things are taken care of as though they’re fine China, like these are my babies so I’m always careful with them. However both of them have died now and it’s frustrating.I bought my first one with my I pad and it only lasted two months before all pressure sensitivity was gone. I use my IPad Pro for artwork, so once that goes these are useless for anything, because you can only achieve hairline strokes after that.Apple won’t replace them nor repair them, so I was forced to buy a new one. I looked it up online and everyone said they last a while so I though okay maybe I just got a bad one.Well bought a new one, this one in its defense, lasted for almost 5 months, but then died too. These aren’t cheap, and it’s becoming really frustrating when you can’t find any answers and there’s no help whatsoever from the company themselves outside of just have to replace the pencil.I don’t know, this is almost $500 already just spent on replacing these pencils. I’m going to buy this last one and if it dies on me as well, then I’m going to look into other styluses. I can’t afford to be buying these things every few months.I guess anyone looking to buy these, just be aware that you may be in for a constant money pit or perhaps I’m just having horrible luck. Whatever is going on, this is very frustrating and I warn anyone who is looking to invest in one of these to keep it in mind.",,
"The pencil itself is great, smooth and accurate. It does very well with drawing and surprisingly well with technical / CAD type drawing. I bought the rubber nub that goes on the tip, it makes it better than just the plastic on glass feel. One drawback is that there is no external charger. It can only be charged by the new iPad. Also, Apple states that the pencil should not be allowed to fully discharge as it can damage the battery. They warn against buying ""Old Stock"" since the battery may have sat around so long it discharged and is damaged to the point it can't charge or hold a charge.",,
I got this for Christmas and used it solid for a couple days. Suddenly it’s started missing parts of letters as I write them which is really frustrating.I wanted an Apple Pencil so bad because of the palm rejection but it’s like it doesn’t work 100% of the time which is really irritating.,,
"I know apple makes great products, and I have a lot of them. But this time I got a lemon. It was delivered to me with Zero percent charge, and would not charge no matter what I tried. I’m obviously returning it, but I intend to order a replacement because I won’t be deterred just because I got the rare dud.",,
"When I first bought the Apple pencil, it worked great. I didn't use it for a couple of weeks and now I can't use it with documents. I can only use it with the Notes app.Disappointing.",,
"I never wrote the review for my order. However, I really disappointed and annoyed by this order. I ordered new Apple Pencil, not used one, but i got a used one. When I gat the item, it wasn’t sealed, and I could find the evidence that it was used before. There were weird stains on the box and manual, (I have not even touched). Also, under the pencil, there were some crumbles. It was so disgusting. So, I will return this order.",,
"Bought this when I bought the iPad in April of 2022.iPad fortunately is still going strong. The pencil on the other hand.First, the pencil worked great. Drew sketches for fun a few times. Wrote a few notes on notepad. Most of the time however the pencil stayed locked in its spot on my iPad cover. It didn’t get used every day, sometimes wouldn’t get used for a week or two.Several days ago it would not connect, does not show up on Bluetooth. When connected the iPad sees it but does not show a charge amount. Went through all of the steps on Apple’s troubleshooting and it’s a bust.Disappointed, $130.00 and lasted five months? Last ditch effort, calling Apple tech.",,
Very nice design- super bummed I own what seems like the only iPad that isn’t compatible with any pencils. Would have loved to use this.,,
The boxes are supposed to be individually wrapped.. mines was not and the box was very damaged.,,
"I have no complaints when it comes to the actual pen, I do however have a problem with paying for something new and getting an opened package with a dirty pencil inside.",,
Cheaper is not necessarily better. This did not work for me. I’m going to spend a little more next time to get the real Apple stylus.,,
"Okay, so I bought this apple pencil 2nd generation.It did not have a vinyl sealing to it. To be honest, I did not realize this right away. I was just happy to see it arrive.Well, then I opened up the box to see that it had black markings on it.Then, it came to me, ""is this not new?""So I looked up Apple Pencil 2nd Generation Unboxing videos on youtube. They all had vinyl packings on them. Which mine did not have.So I called up Amazon to file a return. I was not happy about this at all. But, the lady at the customer servicr was very nice to lead me through the process. So I decided not to get angry and just have another one sent to me.But, unfortunately, the story does not end here.So I got the new amazon package this morning.I opened the amazon box. But the item did NOT have a packing either.I was not amused. But nonetheless I pulled on the plastic to slide the box out of the outer pocket.There was another surprise for me there.When I pulled on the plastic, I could see the bottom the box, not the top(with the apple instructions and everything).Like, literally, the box had been inserted upsidedown by some unknown person before me. I thought, well clearly this is not a new product.But this was my second time getting the pen. I was tired of waiting and I didn't want to go the UPS store again to return my faulty item. So I decided to take a look at the item.Thinking, "" if it was clean, maybe i'll just take it.""Ha!But that didnt work out either. They had sent me a apple pencil 1st generation.I feel like its natural to get a bit angry now. I could have been happy with my pencil days ago. Now I have to go through UPS again.I am upset, angry and very very sad.",,
"Just ordered and Received on Sept 11th 2020 and it is no longer recognized by my Ipad pro 11. It was working and charged as I took it off and put it back on to check battery status, I than took it off to use it and it wasn't working so I went into my Bluetooth to see it said not connected. I clicked the i ""forget device"" placed the pencil back onto the device, found the pencil under avaliable devices but it still wouldn't connect I kept getting an error message. I than turned the tablet off and back on tried it again but this time no pencil was found under ""devices"" or ""avaliable devices"" I tried this over and over and still the same result. The pencil was fully charged so no reason it should be dead but I figured hey what can it hurt to let it charge for awhile to see if maybe it has a batter issue. Let it charge for 30 minutes and still nothing! 4 months old and already useless!!!! I loved this pencil used it to edit photos, used it when creating designs so helpful but it isn't worth $130 if it is going to break after 4 months! Am going to contact Apple tomorrow to see what they can do about it since I purchased it brand new sealed in the box.",,
good but this should be less expensive as other brands have cheaper-priced accessories,,

"After having such good luck with my older iPad and Gen 1 pencil, I assumed that when I bought my new pencil with my new iPad, that the skipping was just the tip.I changed it out.  It didn't help it.  But those were inexpensive tips, so I decided to buy new, more expensive tips.  And that seemed to help, but right away began skipping terribly.I waited too long, and now I can't return it.  And unfortunately, I see no option to buy an extended warranty on a new pencil, to save me if this happens again.Be wary.I use my pencil EVERY SINGLE DAY for artwork.  For myself and for sale.  I am really uncertain what to do.",,

"After less than a year and hardly many use, following one of apple’s many updates, my pencil has completely died.Multiple attempts at restarting the iPad, turning off and on Bluetooth, updating or hard restarting, even forgetting existing connections entirely.Nothing. Even attempted some oddball solution someone suggested of wrapping copper wire around it. I get a grey ‘apple pencil’ pop up on the to-, and that’s it with no change from tapping it, no indication of charge, nothing at all.Considering the thing simply stayed by my desk 99% of the time, for the extortionate price of this product, this is quite inexcusable.At best, they’re built shoddy, with a battery that’ll fry on you with minor use if you’re unlucky. Far more likely given apple’s history, quite frank;y, they’re built cheap as can be with the full expectation that you will have to pay their outrageous repair fees or just replace their faulty products outright.Save your money, don’t buy Apple products. Quality has never been their speciality, and this has never been more apparent than now. This thing is junk, and I regret not simply buying a dedicated tablet for my drawing. In the end, I spent more on a worse product, and got screwed over as a result.Learn from my mistakes,.",,
"I was very skeptical to order a product like this through Amazon knowing there will be issues. I received this Apple Pen 2nd generation on Sep 17, 2022, after the first few days it was working till it wasn’t.. it Stopped charging after 10 days I will be requesting a refund immediately and will never purchase anything from this “store” again. I should’ve known it was going to cause problems when I received the package and the box the pencil came in was ripped and held down by Scotch tape! If I could give no stars I would",,
"Bought it for my son's iPad, which didn't work with it...we had to purchase another different pen compatibleto his iPad...",,
I got the wrong model for my iPad so this will be returned. Wish there was a compatibly chart so I did waste my money. Definitely do your research before buying one.,,
Apple needs to stop paying homage to Steve Jobs and join the modern world. Using the pencil with my iPhone would be a wonderful plus that makes my iPhone 13 purchase disappointing.,,
I RETURNED THIS ITEM TO THE UPS STORE,,
I purchased this item on a whim. After I received it I quickly learned that it was not compatible with my iPad 9th generation. I simply boxed it back up and returned it with the proper labels at UPS. It has been approximately two weeks and I have no update on my return process nor a refund. I would love my return. The product was as it shown in the picture with no blemishes. Im unsure it if worked because it was no compatible. I just want my refund so I can purchase the correct one for my ipad.,,
"It was advertised as less likely to roll, wrong. It rolls right off the table. So level my table. Absolutely! However the advertising that it is less likely to roll is misleading, it just keeps on going - flat side or not. Also the magnetic hold on an iPad is not strong enough to keep the pencil from flying off when you pick the iPad up. So, be careful? Absolutely, but caveat emptor, this pencil may have a lot going for it, but it is still pretty liable to go flying if you are not careful. Word up.",,
"Okay so, this Apple Pencil works wonderfully and accurately. The added “button” switch is great for art programs, which is mostly what I use my iPad Pro for.My biggest problem is the tilt function is busted, and if I try to use it with brushes in Procreate, or other art programs that have compatible brushes with the tilt function, it just gets stuck. As in, it gets stuck in the biggest graduation and it will not respond to angle/tilt and sometimes pressure.After a while I checked the tip of the Apple Pencil and it’s slightly crooked. It seems the mechanism within the Apple Pencil is bent and replacing the tip isn’t gonna fix it.I’m definitely not buying refurbished again with these more specific and expensive accessories! One of the biggest features on this thing just DOESN'T WORK and I have to turn off tilt/angle on all my brush settings...",,
"i had this item sitting in my cart for a while because it was out of stock. when it finally showed up as an option to purchase new, it was on sale for $99! it seemed like a once in a lifetime type of sale because apple products rarely have sales, so i bought it. mind you, it said NEW. i opened the packaging and tried to connect to my ipad and nothing happened. i tried for hours and went through all the apple support forums to try to fix the issue. i finally called apple support and talked to a real agent. she said that it was in fact NOT brand new. it was a refurbished one. it was not apple refurbished so that’s why it was faulty. sucks amazon listed it as “new”",,
"I felt the pencil could offer more features and configuration flexibility!In typical Apple fashion, you pay more for less features!",,
"hard to manage, not very functional, lags behind when screenwriting",,
"I had an Apple Pencil 1 and it had two nibs and they lasted months for each nib.I got this Apple Pencil 2 and it came with no spare nibs and it's default nib was absolutely 100% used out of the box. It's trashed, I can see the metal tip after a week of ownership. Terrible quality and now I'll need to buy new nibs for a brand new Pencil.Edit: Apple's own support is now telling me that it is ""out of warranty"" which means this product is likely over a year old, and has been sitting on shelves or WORSE was used and sold ""as new"" by Amazon. This leaves me with little recourse and a used product.Amazon's quality control continues to slip, I'll likely stop using Amazon for any big ticket purchases if they can't keep their stock under control.",,
"Always charged, barely used, the pencil worked fine at first but now does not. Online Apple support could not provide a solution. Have to travel to service center to get it addressed.",,
"It works fine. The tip comes off if you're not paying attention. It's just as slippery as the ipad, so you may want to pick up a couple extra tips for when you break them off. It works fine on my daughter's 2022 ipad air. It doesn't work on her cousin's older ipad pro, so make sure you get the right pencil for whatever ipad you have. (And don't expect it to work on the next ipad you buy.)",,
"Worked just shy of two months.  Now will not pair, connect or charge.  iPad can see it but will not connect to Bluetooth.  Very disappointed, expected more from apple and a $130 pencil.  Tried every YouTube tutorial to get it reconnected and nothing.  Really second guessing if this was really a new item, or rather one that had been returned.  I hope the seller or someone contacts me.",,
"This is my first attempt at using an Apple pencil; it is a glorified evolution of a wacom pen, minus the buttons.Tried to use the back of the pencil, as eraser, like I would do on a wacom device, and it doesn't seem to work in the few apps I tried.Pressure sensitivity is lackluster; I could make few variants while drawing, compared to my wacom active screen device. Also the noise the tip makes on the surface is quite noticeable; I was in a quiet room and got people giving me the look.If you get an ipad pro, and need to have this pencil, then go for this overly expensive piece of tech; but if you can use wacom products, your wallet will thank you, and your experience will be probably more pleasant. Then of course these are not reasons you may listen, if all you care is to worship Apple products. In my 30+ years as Apple users, I can say that their latest production is lightyears behind what they used to do, just a decade ago.",,
Too expensive but Chinese pencil wouldn’t pair so “oh well”.,,
"The Apple Pencil works like a dream, it’s smooth, convenient and definitely built with artists in mind but it has a few glaring issues1. It’s really expensive so unless you make good money I would get something cheaper2. You can NOT let this hit zero percent, the moment this happens the very tiny battery in it loses it’s charge and it can never be used again. THE MOMENT IT HITS ZERO IT CANNOT BE USED AGAIN!!! For whatever reason no one mentions how you could accidentally flush a hundred and thirty bucks down the drain simply by forgetting to charge it.Don’t buy this, it works really nice but you can find something that works just as well and cheaper that isn’t gonna become useless if you forget to charge it.",,
"I've bought 3 of these!!! ALL of them just stop working except for one that works sometimes. Literally just bought the last one brand new for it to be permanetly dead (battery neglected) right out of the box. Other one cant connect via bluetooth. The last one just decides when it wants to connect. This is the worst excuse of a product i've ever seen, how hard could it be for one of the biggest companies in the world to make a stylus that actually works in late 2022??",,
"I tried writing a few words. It was a joke, the words the iPad interpreted what I had written. Maybe I should keep it for the entertainment value. But no, it was too expensive for that. I wish I knew why it worked for so many reviewers.",,
Make sure to double check compatibility before purchasing,,
my pencil was working jus great when i got it back on christmas. but all of a sudden it stopped working and wouldn’t connect to my ipad air 4th gen and i have no clue why.,,
"Great while it lasted. I’ve had it in-use since the 2021 IPad Pro 12.9 came out, and I noticed the connection was dropping intermittently while using it or between uses as of mid-June 2021. As of tonight (June 27 2021) it is completely dead. Not of a battery issue, but because it refuses to show up in Bluetooth after I followed Apple’s unpairing/repairing troubleshooting steps. That’s $107 down the drain.",,
"The pencil worked fine and as described but it’s life span was very very short. I bought this one in July and now, in November (4 months later) I’ve had to buy another one because it stopped charging. It no longer charges past 4% battery. So, my new one will be here Tuesday and I hope it lasts longer than my first one did. At least the price dropped from $130 to $100. Very disappointing.Update: It’s now June and the replacement that I bought died. It just wouldn’t charge anymore. Had to purchase a third one. Lovely product this is. Sucks that I need it for work.",,
Apple pencil box wasn't didn't come in original plastic wrap . Apple pencil box was open . Hairs inside pencil box . Plastic sticky wrap on the pencil itself appeared taken off then put back on . Pencil itself was dirty. Not what I expected at all . Will be returning,,
"I noticed during the few months that I had this pencil, how often that I would have to pair this to my ipad everyday. It would not hold a charge or work longer than 10 minutes. Eventually had to buy a new one from Walmart. Amazon may have discounts on these pencils, but you take the risk of it not working at all. My advice, pick one up in person from Walmart to get your paper receipt if anything were to ever happen to it.",,
"I bought Apple Pencil Gen 2 because it was better and compatible with my iPad Pro 11-inch. I was excited when I got it, but when I opened the box the box itself was damaged a little. Not terribly, but what was disappointing was it was used the plastic had already been taken off and the pencil was dead. They advertise it as being brand new, but instead its used. Its not much to complain about, but there's some weird satisfaction when you open a new Apple product and I was disappointed not having that satisfaction. But its not a big deal. The pencil on the other hand works great and I use it to take notes, using Notability, in class for college. I really like it and now don't even take my backpack to campus anymore because how much better its gotten. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED if you have either of the iPad Pro",,
"This was the worst product experience of my life. I just bought a 4th Gen iPad Pro, and I got this to go with it. Firat step on the troubleshooting list checked off, boys. They will work together. My Pencil would pair, I could even see it in the General sention of the Settings app. No response on my screen. None.I can doodle with my fingertip, so I know the screen on my iPad's fine. I run through the Whole List of 8 Steps on the appletoolbox website. Nothing works. I call Apple Support.Since I had done all the troubleshooting steps myself (including the forethought to order replacement tips to try), dude basically said I could drive it in or get a replacement after a $16 service fee for my broken brand new item? It is not even 24 hrs in my possession, and they want another $20 to fix what they sold to me broken???No, thanks.",,
"It seems they dont test their used products before selling them. I just received the apple pencil and it doesnt work. When connected to the ipad everything seems to be ok, however when i take it out to use it, instantly gets unpaired.Mediocre",,
"It would have been nice to use this to sign online documents but I discovered I didn't really have the patience to figure out how to use it.  I was told by a family member it could be used to edit things and mark pictures, like if you wanted to blur the face of a child for instance.  I tried it on a picture, though before posting it; I figured it would work when I brought up the picture from storage...nope, thus my frustration trying to figure it out.  Don't use and won't use, which is why I gave it only 1 star.",,
It's nib will loosen out on its own often and sometimes it just won't read it at all. Not to mention there's entire side of a pencil that will read small movements as a double tap and switch your pen to an eraser out of nowhereOther than that it works all right,,
THE USED ONES DO NOT WORK!!! They don't work because they keep the used ones in storage units and when you leave an apple pencil uncharged for a long time they stop working. please spend the extra however much to buy a new one.,,
It's a nice accessory and all for the 2018 iPad pro but you honestly can do without it. I personally am not going to use it that much as I thought I would. I just don't see the use if I'm not a artist or something. To be honest my S-Pen on my Galaxy Note 5 was more amazing than the Apple Pencil 2. That's just my honest opinion. I get more use out of my wireless and magnetic keyboard that came with my iPad pro case than the Pencil. I will be sending mine back and getting a refund,,
"Was it worth the money? That's the ultimate question. The writing and drawing experience is great as usual, With lots of bells and whistles. Any apple enthusiast would probably drop major coin for this accessory without question. But for an average consumer,it's importance is not paramount and I could have lived without the added benifits it provides. Still, the apple pencil 2 is a great product that complements my iPad air. So I will milk it for every dollar I put down for it. And enjoy it as best I can.",,
"I tired to buy a used Apple Pencil cause Amazon claimed for it to be in good condition. When it arrived it was not an Apple Pencil but a dupe instead. I’m not to upset only because the return and refund process was pretty easy, however I am a bit upset that I could only get the money refunded through an Amazon gift card but you loose some you gain some. I recommend just going to apple and buying it there, the pencil is AWESOME. the only thing about the pen I’d say is only buy it for the newer iPads because to connect it had to snap to the device, so you can’t use it on your phone and stuff. But over all I’m in love with this pencil, definitely a good buy for college. Just don’t order it of amazon loves :)",,
"This pen is actually amazing; the feel in the hand, how accurate it is, the way it charges and stores on the side. I’ve had the pen about two months and it’s been great for note taking, which is what I dominantly use it for. But recently while taking notes, it began to stop writing. I tried all the things online and forums to fix it, but I eventually gave in and bought another one and now the new one is fully working again.So just beware if you buy this and it stops working, this pen is not meant to be open and repaired. It’s made to be sold and work for its lifespan, so there is no way to fix or replace parts.Also for 120$ it is disappointing that it doesn’t function on any of my other Apple products at all. Great pen other than that.",,
"Couldn’t even use it because it wouldn’t connect to my iPad, even though I had read multiple articles stating it would work for my model. I ended up giving it to a friend who recently purchased a newer generation iPad, with the magnet strip on the side, and it still wouldn’t work. Be very careful before purchasing. First generation pencil works great; would recommend just getting that instead.",,
Purchased to save a few bucks. Big mistake.Worst Amazon purchases ever.Amazon clearly doesn’t test “Like New” products and uses us as test bench.Amazon is taking shortcuts to increase bottom line at expense of loyal consumers.The new online Walmart,,
The pen was working well this is my 5th time using it and it will not charge hace to keep removing it and setting it back on the charger over and over until it charges… will like to know what I got to do to refund my money back and or get a different one send to me.,,
"I purchased this Apple Pencil for work. The product appears to be intact, but it only charged one time and will not recharge when placed on the charging magnet on the side of my iPad. I have only been able to use the pencil once, and it has not worked since that time. Would NOT recommend!",,
I wouldn’t buy the pencil unless you plan to do a lot of drawing or free style writing. It didn’t serve my needs.,,
"I ordered this pencil to use with my new iPad for school that is coming up. When I used it on the screen, it came up with a squiggly line and wouldn’t write properly. I have since solved this particular issue, but it says its “still in transit” when I asked for a refund when mailing the pencil back to Amazon. I just want my money back for this. Poor customer support and I won’t be purchasing anything related to Apple from them from this point on.",,
"When I received the product, it was odd that the box didn’t have the plastic shrink wrap. The pencil also wasn’t wrapped in plastic when I removed it from the box as it should have been. However the worst part was that it didn’t work at all. I couldn’t get it to pair with the iPad I purchased. I took it to the Apple store and they replaced it. While we were waiting for the technician, my daughter pointed out that the pencil looked used. I didn’t notice it before, but in the bright store lighting it was obvious. Wow, Amazon. That’s pretty cheap. Glad Apple made good on it for me.",,
"Out of the box it wouldn't work, no matter what we tried.  Called Apple Tech. Support and they confirmed it is defective and advised me to take it to the nearest Apple store for replacement, since it has a one-year warranty.  WRONG, Apple won't honor the one-year warranty (I drove to my nearest Apple store explained that Apple Tech. Support sent me there for a replacement and was told, no, Apple won't honor the warranty for products purchased through Amazon).  Don't waste your money on Apple products, I've spent over $6,000.00 in the last five months on Apple desktop, I-Pad, I-Phone XS Max, AirPods Pro and Apple Pencil, and had trouble with every piece of it, requiring at least eighteen calls to tech. support, hours and hours of wasted time and enormous frustration to get their products to work.  Apple has gone straight down the toilet ever since Steve Jobs passed away.  I am seriously considering returning every item that I can get a refund for and going with Samsung replacements.  My Samsung smartphone has performed flawlessly and intuitively ever since I got it four years ago, and hasn't required a single call to Tech. Support.  I've been an Apple fanboy for over 20 years, but after the last five months of frustration and wasted time and energy, I'm not anymore.  You've lost a loyal customer Apple.  Looks like it's time to sell my stock as my experience in the last five months doesn't portend well for this company going forward!!!",,
I am so disappointed because such an expensive pen that breaks that easy. I just dropped the pen and the point broke and the pen now doesn't work. I tried putting it together and I can't. $120 dollar pen that just broke and no warranty anymore. Ugh.,,
"Update!!!! The pencil no longer charges, not even a year and I was told they can’t do anything for me so that sucks!The pencil itself works fine. ITS JUST DIRTY! does not appear new. I don't believe I have been sent a new pencil. I would love to have a refund but I cannot afford to be out of a pencil at the moment because I am travelling. HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED. I feel scammed.",,
"I didn't understand how to connect this and when I got it I tried to connect it by watching videos and reading the instructions but it didn't work. I even made sure that the pencil was compatible with my iPad but it still didn't work. I would recommend getting the $94 one instead, much easier to connect and use. I guess more expensive doesn't mean better.",,
It literally snapped. Not worth the price just get a cheaper deal somewhere,,
The “Apple Pencil” i received wasn’t real. I have a few from apple and these ones feel totally different in weight and you can’t find a comfortable grab on it without switching between paintbrush and eraser.,,
"I am not writing a good review, because I ordered the wrong apple pen for my daughter. ( which is my fault completely) I’m sure this pen is solid, but it didn’t work on my daughters iPad because it’s a newer apple pen. So I had to return it. I returned it July 11th, and still have not received my money back. Today is July 27th!!! I think this is totally wrong on their end😡 I’m out $140 or whatever 😡",,
"The pencil stopped working after a month of use. I did not even use the pencil every day to say that I demanded too much from the product. The pencil always connects, the tip is fine but it doesn't make the lines the way it should. Communication is cut off and the pencil draws when it wants without having good results.I feel disappointed. It is very expensive and it turns out that it does not work properly. Think well before you buy it here.",,
"It's incredible fragile... Yeah, I shouldn't have let it fall, but it's a pencil, pencils fall all the time, it's their second favorite thing to do, they write and they fall to the ground, it's how they roll. But this one died... it's not broken, dented or bended on the outside, but its soul got crushed from the inside... by falling from a 50 cm height.I'll still buy another one, this time I'll make it wear the thickest coat I can find,",,
Don't waste your time if you work in construction or another industry where you may drop this devise.  Dropped mine and the tip broke off.  Replaced the tip but now the pencil doesn't work.  You are better off spending $100 less for a knock off rather than throwing away $130 on this pencil.,,
"The product was late and the incorrect version I ordered. Incompatible with my Ipad. Now, after a month, I will need to send it back and wait for a couple of weeks to use the correct on... Nice way to prepare for college midterms with the tools you need arriving almost at the finals!",,
"I bought the 2nd Gen Apple pencil on Mar/2021 as Amazon renew. On Sep/2021, the pencil stop working (not charging and not be able to write). I called Apple and they told me this pencil is shipped around Aug/2020. So it's out of warranty, that is what the missing bonous point mean.It later turns out the pencil is still working after re-startI also have a surface pro pen, it feels softer than this Apple pencil 2nd Gen. I like it more but I like ipad more than surface pro.",,
"This doesn’t hold as long of a charge as the gen one pencil and the only way to charge it is by attaching it to the iPad.I would prefer for a secondary option to charge the pencil when I am using the iPad and do not want it attached to the iPad for me to lose when I need to charge it. And it costs $30+ more for an already pricy pen for it to actually be more cumbersome to use.Because it can only charge when magnetically connected to the iPad you can no longer easily use pen grips for more comfort cause they get in the way of charging the pen.Also, I have tried two of these and their nibs like to unscrew themselves over time and fall out. And for $30+ they don’t offer you a second nib like they did with gen 1.",,
"The pen I first got had a tip that was stuck on the pen. You couldn't loosen the tip or tighten it, it was stuck. It could charge but couldn't write on the iPad Air 4.Got a replacement pen. It works normally but now there's a new problem with a tip - when I write at a particular part of the tip, the tip is scraping the screen. The tip is defective.I'm not even going to bother asking for another replacement. A defective tip is annoying, but I'm tired of visiting the UPS store to return items so I'm just going to suck it up and deal with it.If you're curious, I'd just get the apple pen 2 in store at a Best Buy or something. That way, you can test the pen directly in store first before you leave - making sure the tip isn't stuck, that it writes smoothly at all angles - even on a screen protector, that it charges, etc.  It's a stress-free no-hassle, compared to buying on Amazon, receiving two defective units and just saying ""screw it I'm just gonna deal with it, ugh.""",,
"Works fine, but not durable. Rolled off the table (maybe a foot drop) and broke.",,
"This was a used Apple Pencil Gen 2 that didn't work at all. I specifically made sure that I checked NEW when ordering. When it came there was no wrapping on the box or on the pencil and the pencil was charged to 100%. Didn't think much about it, but I could not get the pencil to work on my new iPad Air Gen 5. We went to Best Buy and bought a new Apple Pencil Gen 2. The box was sealed, the pencil was sealed and it wasn't charged and after charging it worked great. Wouldn't have been so awful that it was used if it had actually worked. Beware of being scammed by the price.",,
"I recently purchased an IPad Pro 3gen, and a generic stylus pen. I fell in love with the pen but it quit inside of 6 weeks. Since I loved the pen feature I decided to just go ahead and spend $125 more to get what I thought would be a much superior product only to be disappointed. The Apple pen is shaped poorly, it is not a round pen so it doesn’t roll easily in my hands.  The pen is also very heavy as compared to most writing utensils, and the generic pen I purchased.  The Apple pen does not give me the ability to close pages using the swipe up feature, instead I have to free up a finger/thumb to perform this function instead.  The Apple pen performance is a wee bit better then generic stylus, but for my simple purposes the difference was negligible. The double tap, and sidebar charging features weren’t worth the swap for comfort generic stylus gave me.  I expected so much more from Apple If I could return the Apple pen and purchase the generic stylus again, I would.",,
"The used-acceptable Pencil 2 would pair with the iPad but would not work on the screen. It was tried on two iPads, didn't work with either and a good Pencil worked with both iPads. Something may be wrong with the tip or internal pressure sensor. There were a couple of dings at the edge and scratches on the replaceable tip when it was received (see photo) that might indicate it had been damaged though they may just be cosmetic. Our mistake was in not identifying the problem until after the return window had closed, so we're out the cost of the Pencil. Live and learn.",,
"My daughter likes her apple pencil, but she's had it for less than a year (March 28, 2021), and it's dead. The battery life is too short and can't be replaced. It's a shame. I won't be buying her an Apple Pencil (2nd Generation) replacement.",,
"I was very excited to receive this pencil and started using it right away for notetaking and drawing. To my surprise yesterday I tried to connect it to my iPad and it stopped working completely, it refused to connect or even recognize the pencil is there. I went ahead and decided to contact Apple support and received no valuable information. I am very very upset with the quality of this pencil, I did not expect it to stop working like that it is a very expensive pencil it should’ve lasted me as long as I needed it to last. I never even dropped it on the floor or through across the room or anything it is still attached to my iPad there was no damage done by me the pencil simply gave out.",,
"I dropped $1k my iPad pro and apple pencil for digital art, because everyone said it’s the best combo for digital art. With the insane cost, I expected quality and durability. While it worked, it was great, and I made some phenomenal art. But 14 months after I bought the pencil (2 months after the warranty expired), it stopped working. It won’t show up in bluetooth devices, despite showing an “Apple Pencil” message when I magnetically connect it to my iPad. It knows the pencil is there, but will not connect. Because the pencil is a simple, real pencil design, there are no lights, buttons, or screens to see what the issue is, and whether or not there’s a way to fix the pencil. After troubleshooting for 5+ hours, then troubleshooting with apple tech support for 1.5 hours, it still doesn’t work, and an out-of-warranty replacement is $110, plus $7 to ship back your old pencil. You save ten bucks, but the kicker is that a replacement only has a 90 day warranty, compared to a new pencil’s 12 month warranty. This feels like a pre-planned money grab by Apple. I will now be looking into an affordable, non-apple stylus for my digital art.",,
"I keep my iPad in a case. So the magnetic charging option is a complete pain for me. I prefer to have another charging option as before, where it docks into the iPad, so I don’t have to continually take my iPad out of its protective case just to charge the pencil. I’ll be returning this item.",,
"This is not a stylus for everyone; it is very good at what it does for an iPad Pro owner, but it is not an essential to the tablet. If you want to just take notes, a cheaper iPad and the first gen Apple Pencil are more suited towards your needs, IF you have to use Apple, and there are a larger number of alternatives with Windows tablets and Samsung's offerings. If you're in Apples ecosystem, you should consider if you'd be using this stylus constantly to justify the price.",,
"Spending the most, expecting the best. But it arrived today and REQUIRES you to attach it to an iPad Pro to charge. So, off came the expensive ZUGUI Case to attached the pencil for charging. The pen slide off with the slightest movement, as the magnet is very weak. Worse, it does not work, even with a relatively new iPad Pro! (Will not work with the phone or any other of the 3 iPads I own). I am returning it and ordering the original pencil that you can CHARGE via a cable. I can protect my iPad again with the great casse.  So many gimmicks now with Apple products, and far too many ""updates"" that make things worse. WTF?",,
"I purchased this for my daughter to use on her IPad generations 7.  I am a computer consultant, so both my daughter and I know how to set up electronic devices. After trying for an hour to get this to connect to her IPad via Bluetooth my daughter called Apple.  The first phone call she was told to connect the pencil to the right side of her IPad via the magnetic connection and to let it fully charge before trying to connect it to the IPad via Bluetooth.  She was told that during the charging process that the pencil and IPad would connect via Bluetooth automatically.  After letting the pencil fully charge my daughter found out that they still would not connect to each other.  That's when she called Apple the second time.  This time she was told that the Apple Pencil 2 will only work with the IPad Pro, not the IPad generation 7, even though it was a new model.  She was told that she would have to return the Apple Pencil 2 and order the older version Apple Pencil 1 in order for it to work with her IPad.  Nowhere in the description on Amazon's website does it explain this.  Make sure you go to Apple's website to find out which pencil will work with your IPad BEFORE ordering one.",,
"The only issue is that I bought the newest Apple Pencil mistakenly thinking that I could use it with my iPad 6th gen because  I misread the compatibility, it said 6th gen for a iPad MINI, and they were quick about getting the right one to me and doing the exchange but I paid 124$ with KLARNA , I was then charged 89$ for the exchange and credit for 89 but I’m still paying 124? So I’m paying 124 for the older style pencil? I really don’t understand how that works . I am happy with the product though. And what’s worse is I can’t seem to talk to anyone about it!!!",,
"The pencil itself is amazing, but I've only has this for a little over 2 weeks and have already worn through the tip and can see the underlying metal. For an Apple product as expensive as this is, I would expect the tip to last longer and even come with some replacements. I figured I would have to replace them, just not nearly this soon.",,
I’ve had three of these in the past 6 months.  Spent over 100$ in fuel bringing it back and forth to Apple for Repair/replacement.  They’re just “quit working”  Finally bought an after market pen fora fraction of the cost and haven’t had an issue. they will not let you mail it in for repair  They really dropped the ball on this one  Do better Apple,,
"Bought this “brand new” from Amazon, and it came in used and beat up. Worst part it’s not even a generation 2 pencil. It’s someone’s old beat up generation 1 pencil, this is completely disgusting that Amazon would allow something like this to come out. Thanks for the ruined gift Amazon.",,
"Expensive (surprise, it's Apple). It's heaver than most styluses I've tried, and really small diameter while being really long. It's also not balanced at all, the majority of the weight feels like it's in the back instead of the front, so it's hard to feel confident in small writing or drawing details. The matte material is also surprisingly slippery. I'm sure it's better than the P1, but I think if they made a 3rd gen and finally made it battery-free then it'll be lighter and cheaper (hopefully).",,
Too expensive,,
"The original box has noticeable traces of dirty scuffing; there is no information booklet inside (there are only two booklets with warranty descriptions in different languages).  Also, the box is unsealed. It appears to be an open-box product - but I did not see any notice when I bought it, and I bought it as new.I bought it as a gift, but I can't give it as a gift in this condition, so I returned it.",,
The Apple Pencil condition was said to be new however the packaging made it seem like the product was used. There was no vacuum seal wrap around the package and the bag it came in was giving an unusual perfume smell.,,
"Very disappointed! Its supposed to work on my ipad pro 11 & the new mini but doesn't... the different things its supposed to do...it doesn't. Not worth $125. when there are so many other pens that work really well that you can use on all the apple devices, that only $30. to $50. but work really well! Dont waste your money on this pen...you do not have to buy that pen!",,
"Purchased new in December 2019. Stopped working in July 2021. In that time I used it to take notes at meetings, and my teenager used it to draw. Under 10 hours total usage.After an hour on the phone with Apple, they determined the pen was defective and offered to look at it - not fix it, look at it - for a $109 service fee.I told them that I have been an Apple customer for 15+ years, and that since the pencil was obviously defective, I hoped that they would fix it or replace it fort me. They didn't actually laugh, at least until the call ended, but they refused to do anything. ""Constantine"" said that the people who denied my request ""do not take phone calls"" and that I was welcome to give feedback on the website, but could not promise any response.I hope Apple treats you better than this if you buy a defective product, but don't count on it.",,
didn’t know this one wasn’t adaptable to my ipad so i would know how it truly works :/,,
"Today, Aug. 27, 2022, I received my new apple pencil box. Yes! No pencil. When I opened the box the pencil was no where to be found. I know that Apple usually wraps all its boxes in plastic, this one was not wrapped. I gave it one star because I can't rate something I do not have.",,
"I bought this as used because it said it was certified by Amazon and like new, so figured I'd save the extra bucks. I received today and the apple pencil 2 box was there. Inside was a knock off $20 pencil......... this is pathetic amd extremely disappointing. Worst part is that is was ""sealed"" with a sticker that said it had been checked. Well either whoever checked it doesn't know what they are even checking or they are intentionally screwing people over. Very disappointed by this amazon",,
"I use this to teach in zoom lessons at school. It stopped working today and won't pair up. I spent an hour on apple tech to try and get a replacement. They wanted to know the serial number, and told me to look in the barrel of the cap. They are the TINIEST letters and numbers ever, and impossible to read. It worked last night and now nothing. It has dropped off my ipad once or twice, but not at a high distance or on a hard floor. Very disappointed. Teaching is hard enough right now, especially as a music teacher, but tech failures are even worse right now and thinking about getting a new one is impossible right now.",,
"Received the original pen and gave it to my niece as a Christmas present. Not reading the reviews we didn’t know about the battery glitch and how you shouldn’t let it get to zero percent otherwise it won’t hold a charge again. First of all that’s a terrible glitch for such an expensive product but anyways…it died to zero didn’t work. Okay fine, we’ll exchange it and be more cautious about charging habits. They replace it and the one they send won’t hold a charge AT ALL. So I’m assuming at this point they’re just rotating defective pens to people who are buying them instead of fixing the issues. Very disappointed.",,
"Connects on and off when drawing or writing In notes. , and I can barely get it to charge. Perhaps it’s because I didn’t purchase it brand new. I wish I had. But I purchased a replacement and sadly it never came. I was hoping it would arrive before the return window for this pencil but since it hasn’t I will have to return it. It helped when it came to typing and clicking with it, simple tasks. Sadly it would skip when I was attempting to write in my notes and I ended up giving up and just typing everything out. I eventually ended up getting creative and attempting to draw with the skips and trying to create an imagine anyway. Wasn’t so great. But hopefully when I purchase a new pencil, I’ll be updating my review",,
"when connected to my old gen iPad it was very laggy, and the device shape seems hard to have a. grip on.",,
"Work a little over a week, pair easy with apple air 4th generation, battery life excellent until it died. when you place pencil on side of airpad shows device, no longer shows % of battery left, called apple but not much help, decided to return. I have a Meko 2 in one that works with all my apple products you get 2 pens and extra tips for about 18.00 on amazon.",,
The tip of mine got 2 cracks right before the tip on opposite sides. I did keep in a book bag on my iPad with a magic keyboard. And it also works about 67% when double tapping tip to get eraser and pen. Other than it’s great for keeping phone logs at work through the notes app.,,
"This pencil stopped working after a few months. I tried everything to fix it such has restarting my iPad, updating the software, turning off and on blue tooth, forget device and repair.... but nothing worked. So I called Apple support and spent about 1 hour 30 minutes on the phone with Apple support. The support person had no idea how to fix it, but kept me on the phone for ever asking me random questions about the weather. In the end the support person offered me the option to take it to Best Buy so the can check it, because the warranty was still not up. So I went to my appointment at Best Buy where they took the pencil to check on it only to take it back to me saying they could not fix it and they do not know what’s wrong with it. Also they at Best Buy did not have the equipment to run a diagnostic test on it, only contacted Apple which suggested to buy a new one. So just like that $120plus gone... because this pencil will not work and I Apple support will not honor the warranty.",,
"This was supposed to be a new Apple pencil. I pulled it out of the box (which wasn’t shrink-wrapped) and the end of the pencil was slightly dirty. The pencil would charge but not function at all. The pencil’s serial number (listed in the settings on iPad) didn’t match the # on the box. Looks like Amazon is pawning off a broken, used pencil as new. Not cool.At least returns are easy. But someone in the supply chain is trying to rip off the end purchaser. I should have just gone to the Apple Store.",,
"I'm positive I bought this new, but it looks like a product that someone recieved and then returned. The pencil has a small dent in it so hopefully it still works but the pencil box itself looks like it was thrown around the warehouse a few times to check durability. I guess buy directly from apple or a retailer if you want the best looking product for your $120.",,
After only a year it's developed hairline cracks all over it. It's never been dropped and my iPad rarely even leaves my desk. Very disappointed.,,
"As much as this costs should work better, doesn’t work well. I have to use my finger most of the time.  Only works half the time",,
"Well, I'm new to Apple products so I didn't realize the labrynthian product release plan they have across multiple items. I got the Apple Pencil 2 thinking that it would be compatible with the latest ipad. It is, if you bought the latest ipad PRO. If you have a regular ipad, no matter when it was released, sorry, you just bought a useless piece of plastic.All I've ever heard was that Apple is so good with support, compatibility, and ease of use. I guess I should've figured out that was a complete lie when I was simply trying to figure out which was the latest ipad! The legion of releases, generations, and years associated with each iteration is astounding, and now, this. If it doesn't have broad support across releases from the same year, why would you call it Pencil 2, instead of Pencil PRO, which is a far more fitting way of presenting it?!I'm convinced that Apple intentionally baffles people with the way it labels and presents its product labels, strictly to sell more of their stuff. They can cram the Pencil PRO. I share some of the blame, obviously, but this is ridiculous, and deceptive, at BEST.",,
The apple pencil is great for the ipad. But after 2 or 3 weeks it stop working. I call apple and there nothing they can do until they get the pencil since the pencil doesn’t connect to the iPad.,,
I didn't expect to receive an open-box and used item that was not disclosed at the time of order.,,
"I pay for a brand new Apple Pencil, but what I received is an opened box Apple Pencil. There is no plastic paper for the box and the Apple Pencil.",,
its alright. it works so far but was way overpriced,,
"I purchased a used ""like new"" apple pencil, and both ends of the pencil were chewed off, completely unable to be used.",,
I bought this for my new iPad Pro. It was supposed to be new. It was not. The box was not sealed. The instructions were shoved in the box haphazardly and the pencil would not connect to my iPad. I know it is not the iPad as it is brand new and all my other Bluetooth items connect with no problem. Apparently I should have read the other reviews more thoroughly. I now have to make a special trip to return the item. What a pain in the you-know-what. How can Amazon let this happen to so many customers? Ridiculous!!!,,
"Ok, so this is the second attempt at an Amazon Warehouse purchase of a used Apple Pencil 2. The first wouldn’t pair or charge at all so it was useless. I returned it for another which came in with bite marks on the nib and front part of the pencil itself. I purchased this used for a variety of reasons and expected some wear, but this is a little over the top. I have had luck with Amazon’s Refurbished and used items before, but this one was definitely not a good experience overall.",,
I had an issue with my delivery. Once I finally received it the Pencil tip is too damaged and now it can’t be used. It charges with no issues but I can’t use it until I receive the extra tips I ordered. This Apple Pencil should not be listed for $97 for the condition that it’s in. I could’ve purchased a new one with the money I spent on this used Apple Pencil and extra tips I ordered. Extremely disappointed!!!!!,,
"Pencil seemed awkward.  Worked with it for about a week and could not see where it was worth the price.  Had been told by sales rep at Apple that I would not be able to use pencil to change screen from bottom bar.  Should have dismissed purchasing at that time. Thought that a lot more effort was required to use it than anticipated.  Poked my screen so hard was afraid i’d break it.May be good for someone using graphics a lot, which I do not.",,
"This product was not brand new, there wasn’t any wrapping and when we opened it the pencil was dirty and clearly used. Gross.",,
"The pencil is easy to use, and pretty accurate. Unfortunately, the functionality is reduced, and you cannot even do simple operations like swiping up to close apps or down to bring up menus. It is an overpriced piece of technology with reduced functionality. I am an Apple fan but not a fan of this particular product. Apple, you can do better than that!",,
"Carefully if it falls when charging, because its like 99% that it will damage the sensitivity. It happened to mine",,
Delivery was very fast (2 day delivery) but product came with packaging slightly open and a Apple pen that has scuff marks where the pen is magnetized.Apple pen also connects to the iPad but does not function as a pen at all. Definitely a defective piece.Would like a full refund on this or at least an explanation on how something could be shipped like this,,
The wrapping was not in tact (first sign). Then charged slowly. Also no hover feature unless you tap the screen several times. Had to return.,,
"It works well enough, however, when the plastic tip is screwed all the way in it’s a little off center from the rest of the Pencil. I don’t know if it’s a defect of the pencil or just the cheap plastic tip, because it didn’t come with any spare tips I could compare against. I know it sounds like I’m nitpicking, but high price, high expectations.",,
"Really expensive.  I also dropped it by mistake after it didn’t properly stick to the magnetic iPad siding and the tip was bent slightly and only worked on one half of the pen. I purchased replacement tips but for the price  and accuracy is sometimes slightly off, I would expect a better quality pen",,
"I like that the pencil magnetically attaches to the iPad and charges in that position. The big negative for me is that the magnetic attachment is very weak, and the pencil falls of with a slight jar, even with the apple ipad keypad/cover. Apple needs to come up with a more secure way to attach the pencil.",,
"Product came opened, with no seal. The box was roughed up, and had marks on it as if it was a used retuned item. I bought it as a gift, when I opened the pencil it looked slightly different than the one I had. Upon testing the pencil I realized that the magnet was not as strong and the pencil itself was a bit thinner than the one I have. I then compared it to my sisters Apple pencil and found the same defects. It seemed like either a really good fake that had been returned in an original box. Very very disappointed, quality control was zero, I could have otherwise just gotten it from the apple store but because of time constraint opted to do so with PRIME. Also, this product was to be sent overseas so returning it is going to be a nuisance from a different country. HIGHLY disappointed. Never buying apple products from amazon again, do not trust the verification at all.",,
"So i just got my 2nd generation pencil with my new ipad mini 6 when it released. I used my pencil and drew on my ipad dam near everyday with no issues. Then the update happened and all of a sudden it doesn't work. It’ll show its connected but no response to screen touch. Ive reset the ipad, forgot the pencil and turned Bluetooth off idk how many times. Im glad even though i ordered it from Amazon apple still covers it for a year so i guess ill have to goto the store and see what they do. Just beware right now cause buying a 100$ pencil that doesn't work with the once device i have to work with it is a little irritating.",,
"Ordered a “used” one through Amazon to save money. Arrived defective and didn’t pair with my iPad at all. (Yes, it was the right generation.) Customer service was very nice though and the return process was very fast! I got another one in person from Best Buy and it worked instantly.",,
Much too expensive,,
"Apple only allowed me to order one for our school.  I understand if it's a special price, but I couldn't fulfill a second teacher's order direct from Amazon at any price!",,
Good but stopped working and charging after using  twice.,,
"I purchased it because it says it is available for iPad 8, but it does not work for it.",,
Worked wonders for just over 3 months then it wouldn't connect with my ipad anymore and the battery percentage no longer shows up when connected to the magnetic strip. If it lasted longer I would have given it five stars. It truly has amazing accuracy and was great with the procreate app. Unfortunately its just passed the 90 day coverage.,,
had to return,,
"The pencil died a few days after first charging and using it, and refused to charge. From reading reviews I see I'm not the only one experiencing this problem. I visited the Apple store, they said they wouldn't help me because I got it from Amazon. After troubleshooting with an Amazon tech expert, I was sent back to Apple. For such an expensive stylus I was hoping for more reliability and more helpful customer service. :(",,
Works great but $125 for a stylus is insane.,,
Took a bit to connect with Ipad pro. Then worked fine for a coupleof days then Started having problems connecting and now won't work anymore,,
Bought new but got a used one. The apple pencil does not even pair with my ipad pro. Returning the item.,,
I am on my 3rd Apple Pencil. The first one the tip broke off and new tips would not screw back on. The second one just quit charging after a month. For apple products they are not good quality. Hopefully apple gets it together.,,
"This pencil is fragile. It worked great for 5 months then, I dropped it. I bought it because of its wonderful features. But the price was steep. I have to call it a bad purchase.",,
The charging works well. The fact it sits on the iPad via magnetism is great. I am finding little use for it. The Scribble program is not very good at recognizing my handwriting. There are many apps that use it but it just underwhelms me. Too expensive. Sorry I bought it.,,
Was listed as new but was used.,,
This pen was poorly made! This pen just lasted me 3 months and i paid full price for it…DO NOT BUY,,
I could not get the pencil to charge or connect to my iPad. I even tried allowing it to charge overnight because I thought I wasn’t giving it enough time and still nothing. The pencil wouldn’t even show up on my iPad.,,
I bought it for my daughters new iPad Pro on Black Friday. It would show that the pencil was on but not ask to connect. We went to Best Buy to ask for help why it wasn’t asking. I did so much research on YouTube. It’s a waste of time! Just go to reputable place and buy it there. It’s sent back since it wouldn’t connect or write anything. I’m just going to Best Buy once I get the money back to buy it there.,,
Magnets aren’t strong enough and I find myself constantly dropping it when attached to iPad with out a case that has a built in pen holder. I’m finding it less and less useful.,,
"Wasn't working well to begin with but initially I thought it was user error because I never used an Apple Pencil. After various troubleshooting efforts it was just frustrating to use so I left it alone forever. I finally tried it again because I signed up for a digital art course only to learn the Apple Pencil stopped working entirely. I tried to troubleshoot it myself following all the instructions on Apple's website. Nothing worked so I reached out to Apple ""support"" (biggest joke of the decade). I got booted after half an hour of frustration being pointed back to the page on how to troubleshoot the product myself, and that it'd be $119.99 + $20 for repair plus shipping. Don't do this to yourself",,
"Compré dos de estos lápices porque estaba más económico en Amazon, pero ambas cajas llegaron abiertas.",,
"The used Apple Pencil (2nd Gen) I bought on Amazon did not work at all, wouldn’t sync to iPad Pro, even after charging for a day. However, I provided the serial number from the Pencil box to AppleCare support, who confirmed it was still under warranty and replaced it for free. So, ultimately I got a refurbished Pencil from Apple at an Amazon pre-owned discount.",,
"I really thought this would work with a wider set of ipads, not just last years pro model.  Not even an iphone?",,
I got the product I didn’t think must of it when it came without a plastic wrap everything was fine until like 20 days later it stopped working I’m so mad because the reason I got the pencil was for school now it’s just ups and stopped working I’ve tried everything I wasted my money and I’m pissed,,
"it isnt compatible with my device. that was my fault for not double checking. however, its been awhile since i returned the pencil, and i still havent gotten my refund. im waiting to get my money back to buy the generation 1 pencil :,(",,
Make sure to read the specs. This second generation is only compatible with 4 types of iPads. And it’s not compatible with the most put to date generation. Not only that this one doesn’t come with a charging apparatus. Very disappointed in Apple and I am now shopping other brands that actually come with a charger and is compatible with the 8 th generation,,
Pencil gave out and doesn’t work. I’ve tried everything and have read lots of things to do in order to make it work. Nothing worked.,,
I have an new iPad generation 8 and this pencil is not compatible.  By the time I contacted Apple Support my window of return had expired on had 30 days.  So I had to contact Amazon and pay a restocking fee to return the item.  Please check to see which pencil works with your product before ordering.,,
If you have the Ipad pro you'll want one. Overpriced just like the Ipad pro. Yeah they both are amazing but expensive. Feels good in hand like a pen and works well.,,
"I guess I made a huge mistake buying though Amazon because I’ve had to buy two of these and both are broken. The first one never worked, it was delivered with a dead battery. Returned it ASAP and got a new one, now that one worked fine up until two days ago. I got to use it for about two months, but one day it just wasn’t charging or connecting at all to my iPad. There should be no reason for it to already be dead, I’ve only had it for a couple months and it’s charge never got below 90%The pen itself is fine, you’re just taking a risk getting it through Amazon.",,
I didn’t even have it for a year and it quit charging!  There is no way to fix it so I’m out $129 on pencil that doesn’t work!  Can’t begin to say how upset I am about this and it has really turned me away from Apple products!,,
"Doesn't work.  Buy it from apple. Amazon wont even help you, you have to contact apple anyway. This has been a waste of time and energy",,
stopped connecting to my ipad in just a few days of using,,
I can’t believe that I received this!  It came in a 2nd generation box but really is the 1st generation and WITH CRACKS on the cap. (not even sure if it’s a faked one or not.) it doesn’t even fit the box!  I thought this link is directly sold by Apple. How can this happen??!!!,,
Charging but not writing this is the second pencil I’ve had the same problem with .,,
I was unable to connect to my 12.9-in iPad Pro 5th Gen. but Amazon Prime returns are painless.,,
This product was misrepresented.  Once received it did not connect with my iPad despite  the site saying it was compatible.  I’m very disappointed with the seller!,,
"I am a loyal Amazon long term customer, I had the chance to purchase a long the years many items and the majority of the times, with no issues, with a one time exception, in which I did a huge mistake and count on ""Amazon warehouse"" and purchase a ""like new"" apple pencil 2nd generation. Huge huge mistake, the pencil worked for around 2 hours and than it stopped working, with out any visible reason (internal HW issues). I highly recommend anyone out there , to NOT count on Amazon, and always make sure you purchase a NEW sealed item.",,
"There is no way to charge this without an iPad Pro 3rd generation.  This should be front and center with any description of the Apple Pencil 2.  The description lists it is compatible with many Apple products, but it can only charge with an iPad Pro 3rd generation iPad.  There are no docks, external chargers, adaptors, anything.  It needs a $1000 charger called a iPad Pro 3rd generation or newer.  Thanks Apple :(",,
The pencil stopped working after a few mon.,,
Doesn't hold charge. I tried to leave it charging for a while and it still at 0%. I must had received a defective one.,,
"I received my product with the tip extremely bent and damaged, not suitable for the iPad since it can scratch the screen. It’s exposing metal at the tip. I hope they can give me a free tip replacement.",,
"I ordered this 2nd Gen Apple Pencil and I received an opened item (no plastic wrap on box), and the box and packaging was for the 1st Gen Apple Pencil - HOWEVER, the pencil itself looked like it was the 2nd Gen apple pencil? I check the model numbers on the box just to make sure, and the box was for 1st gen, but the pencil itself was 2nd Gen... something weird going on for sure. I'm not sure if the pencil itself worked, as I just returned without trying it out. I didn't want a pencil without the proper serial number and packaging/info/directions. I will be buying this pencil directly from apple.",,
"After only 5 months of use, the pencil was deemed defective - Contacted Apple for replacement",,
The item itself is great however the boxing was terrible and the item was obviously used a lot.,,
"It literally did not work . I reset my iPad , reconnected the pencil & still wouldn’t work . The inside of the tip was very filthy like completely dirty it was nasty . Cleaned that off to see if it would work , still nothing never again will I buy .",,
Had to return tip kept falling off,,
"My second generation Apple Pencil was received unopened, but wasn’t unfortunately opened until a month after receipt (the deadline for returns). The pen was a fake! I had to replace it with one from Target and the technician agreed that it was fake. It’s appearance was certainly different than the one associated with the product marketed by Amazon. So buyer beware. This is not cheap and prospective customers out to consider Target or the local electronics store. I’ve never bought a fake item at target and the return if I had would be a lot easier.",,
Bought for birthday present.  Wasn’t compatible with IPad.  Window to return closed day before party.  I cannot return it 😡,,
"Very useful tool, but the build quality does not match the price. $100+ for a plastic pen? The surface pen is metal and hosts more features at $100.",,
"I have only had the pencil for about 2 weeks. I purchased it along side the new iPad Pro. I have used it mostly for note taking and project planning at work. The pencil performs phenomenally, especially with procreate and notability. It is very responsive and easy to draw with. The pressure sensitivity is excellent. Unfortunately, the tip quickly wore out after less than 2 weeks. I was expecting at least a few months, even with heavy usage. THE TIP IS NOT COVERED BY THE WARRANTY. Because they expect the tip to get damaged, apple will not offer replacements.",,
The pen is perfect! Always ify to see or buy stuff online but so far so good,,
"Honestly this product was awesome. It did not survive a drop. The nib snapped in half, leaving half of the nibs core stuck inside the pencil. Tried to remove it and it cracked. Sad and out $120. Guess its time to pick up some overtime.",,
This is for the iPad Pros only!,,
Gets stolen if you leave it down Tip breaks easily and with replacement tip the pencil does not work. I’ m my third ipencil now,,
received it damaged. It won’t connect or charge. Complete rip off. And Apple won’t replace it because it’s serial number won’t come up in the actual Apple system.,,
It's an over priced pencil but the kids love it.,,
"Purchased an Apple pencil for my granddaughter, accidentally dropped on a ""carpeted"" floor and stepped on. The thin plastic tip of the pencil has minute splits and no longer works. They do not repair these nor offer Apple Care for them. Its durability is poor and it damages easily, Then its an expensive and useless piece of plastic.",,
"I ordered a new 2nd gen apple pencil and received an open box 1st gen. I was immediately suspicious when I realized it wasn’t shrink wrapped, and then saw the box was also torn. When I took it out it was clearly apparent it was not even a 2nd gen. They don’t look the same and it had to be plugged in to charge. I’m pretty sure it’s already been returned at least once for that reason and shipped right back out. Apple pencils are great, but don’t waste your time and buy one from somewhere more reputable. I learned my lesson.",,
"3 weeks ago, I purchased the 2021 Apple iPad Pro and thought it would be good idea to also buy an apple pencil 2.I am a computer specialist and I spent 4 days trying to pair the pencil, followed all the instructions but nothing works. I can see a button ""tap to connect"", then nothing happens.I charged it with my iPad as instructed but nothing works.So, I am out of the country and I can't even return it for replacement.It's a total loss of money.",,
"I didn't know this when I purchased it, so I had to return it, and my refund could only go into my amazon account.",,
This product does not work on my iPad so I promptly returned it.I went to the UPS store on August 12th. It's now August 27th and no money returned.Beware of this.,,
And that’s all there is to it folks. Really aggravating.,,
It arrived quickly but unfortunately it doesn’t work.,,
I like that I can write n my iPad like a pen. What  I don’t like is I can only use it only to write on my I pad.,,
I bought this in May 2020. It has now been just over a year and it has suddenly stopped working. Fund it very ironic that it stops right after the year warranty has run out.,,
"Everything is fine with it, but changing suddenly to the raiser while I am writing really bothers me. I do not know if everyone is facing this issue or not, but it just wastes my time if I want to write something.",,
This product needs to be looked at in a design way by Apple. The pencil tip is flimsy and will break off with even slight pressure applied too much at once. I've replaced it 3 times in 2 years. It's unibody design is a horrible idea since you can't fix anything about it if one part breaks.,,
"The product wasn't compatible with all the iPads, and to be honest the added features compared to the 1st generation do not warrant upgrading to the new iPad or pencil for most uses. I am thoroughly disappointed in Apple for their design decisions for this generation.",,
tip broke off within a year,,
I order this reading great reviews on it and when I received it I noticed that there was no seal on it then I opened and the Apple Pencil had no seal on it and the tip had marks of use on it. I checked back and it said I paid for a brand new Apple Pencil for $120Currently returning to buy a new one!,,
Purchased this to go with my company issued iPad Pro.  Did not work from day one.I worked with our IT department..through three escalations and went to Geek Squad at Best Buy.  Still not working.,,
"I'm not sure if Amazon got a shipment of defective 2nd gen apple pencils or if this is how long the battery is supposed to last.I have had the pencil for 2 months and it will drop from 100 percent charged to 20 percent in less than 2 hours of use.I thought I was crazy.. But, I rebooted the iPad Pro and charged both again.. And it happens literally every time now.Of course it happens after the 30 days mark.. So how easy is it to rip people off this way.I have an iPad with an 1st gen and it can go days with out a charge..This 2nd gen can be fully charged and dies in about 90 mins..?Literally like stealing 130 dollars because it's basically useless at this point for any type of real world scenarios.",,
This is a great stylus but it does not work for me because I need a stylus that will navigate and open and close apps also. I have very oily skin and cannot use my fingers to swipe or I end up with a screen that is a greasy mess. I ended up purchasing the Zagg Pro stylus that has a rubber nub on the top to open and close apps. If Apple would put that on top of their pencil it would be perfect,,
"I am beyond unhappy with this very expensive purchase. Right at the deadline to return it, it began becoming very unreliable. For $120 and being an Apple product I expected more. It disconnects often, and resists the initial attempts to reconnect it. Since i purchased an iPad for the main purpose of drawing this is a losing proposition.Do not recommend.",,
"I'm careful with my technology.  Especially Apple Tech.  I have kept it attached to the Ipad while not using, and haven't dropped, thrown or otherwise miss-handled this pencil.  Though there are cracks up both sides almost like the battery is defective and expanding.There are MULTIPLE reports of the 2nd gen pencils having this same issue and Apple refuses to address.  I'm going to contact apple to submit a case so they can track, and reach out to the seller in hopes I change this rating.I will say other than the cracks which are driving me BATTY - the $100+ pencil does work great on the iPad Pro 11",,
The item was working perfectly fine for a month and then out of no where it stopped. I had to talk with customer support and they suggested getting an appointment. I went to Best Buy and they told me to go to apple and there they replaced it. DONT BUY FROM AMAZON. GET IT FROM APPLE THEMSELVES.,,
"Is an ergonomically good design, but on the charging part, I would give 2 stars ⭐️ ⭐️ Out of 5.Apple needs to rethink this one. So that we can recharge the pen in an alternate way, besides the tablet itself.",,
"I ordered this yesterday, and used Prime to get it today. Everything looked pretty nice and official until I looked inside. The Apple Pencil wasn’t even in there! There were only bolts and screws for some reason. Underneath the bolts and screws, there were little yellow stains, too. Later, I noticed that it said, “Designed by Apple in Californi.” There was a typo! I had to return it so now they’re sending me a replacement. Still confused why that happened.",,
"Ordered this item on Oct 4,2021. Now it doesn’t work anymore.",,
"I received the pen and go to open it and it isn’t even an Apple Pencil. It doesn’t have the logo anywhere on, even though it came in an Apple Pencil box. And it doesn’t work with my iPad. Definitely not worth your money.",,
"The pencil stopped charging and stopped working right outside of the return window. If you must have it, get it from an actual apple store. Over $100 for a pen that doesn’t work more than 3 months is outrageous 😡",,
"It stopped working! It worked fine for like a week. Then it stopped working, the iPad doesn’t recognize it. What can I do? Help please",,
"This Pencil worked fine for 29 days.  Then it wouldn’t pair, charge, or connect to iPad Pro.  It doesn’t have an on/off button and can’t be reset.  Hard reset of ipad wouldn’t work.  Pencil is now a waste of money.  Just buy a Stylus.  Amazon only gives that 30 days for return.",,
I'm a college student and used my pencil all the time when it would stay connected but it never did and today it didn't connect at all to my iPad Pro which is why I am returning it.,,
"This is the classic case of cool technology failing miserably to the tried and true analog pencil and pen. While sleek and cool, it’s just inefficient. It doesn’t come with a charger. You have to take the iPad out of its case to pair and charge the pencil - and it’s not easy to get the case off. The handwriting conversion to text is more annoying than helpful. Get a good keyboard instead if you want to take notes or type onto an iPad.",,
BAD  PENCIL,,
,,
"DO NOT BUY!!I honestly loved this pencil at first and it was my go to for EVERYTHING!  Out if nowhere my pencil just stopped working.  I did everything I could to fix it, following all the troubleshooting tips, spoke to tech for Amazon and Apple, nothing worked.  And it went out coincidentally right after the period for return was up, so I am out of $139 because Apple won’t honor Amazon’s warranty.  Just buy it through apple in case this happens to guarantee they replace it or do not waste your time, money or get your hopes up.  I am very disappointed.",,
"Just got it today it didn't come with a tip, so I went to the apple store to buy some. It still didn't work, and they couldn't fix it. So, I ended up buying a new pencil on the spot. Just buy a new one from apple to save time and money.",,
The pencil head is defective. It'll scratches my iPad screen!,,
"the pencil was nice, had a nice touch. But I never got try and figure out the full functionality becusae it came off my iPad pro in less than 3 weeks and is now lost forever. It ataches with a magnet to the side of the iPad which means it is prone to getting knocked off and coming loose. happens enough times to me in 3 weeks that is was inevitable it would be lost. the battery is not strong enough to hold it reliably. They should develop an APP that has the iPad sound an alarm if its more than 5 feet away or have a wire attachment option (sorry mr jobs).  So without a pencil, it is useless. At this cost I cannot replace them at will.",,
Limited functions.  Make sure you have the right device!!! Bought two versions of these and neither works work either of my devices,,
"This is an amazing pencil.  I highly recommend it. Works great with Procreate.  However,  I purchased Nov 2019 but stopped working July 2021. Turns out if you don't keep the pencil charged the battery can die and will no longer work.  This is an expensive pencil and it's easy to leave in a draw or on a night stand for extend period of time.  Apple needs to fix this issue or extend the warranty.",,
"It is fake! Compared to our old Apple 2nd pencil, it is different in color, different in design, and different in material. It doesn’t even look like the photo on the box! The wrap inside the box is very cheap. There’s also a sentence inside: “Designed by Apple in Californi “ (NOT California). Are you kidding me?",,
"Unfortunately it sucks a lot of battery from the ipad, specially if you let it overnight attached to the ipad.",,
"It didnt work, it didnt charge and was not campawith any device. I had to return it.",,
"This could be a big improvement over AP1, with double tap functionality and better balance.However, AP2 is designed for continuous charging while attached to iPad, and it drains quite a bit of tablet battery while not using the device. I believe it was about 15-20% drop overnight when I had it. This was a deal breaker.",,
"If you drop it or if it falls off an insecure parking place, it’s toast.  I am reluctant to purchase another for fear of the same outcome.",,
This pencil must make physical contact with your iPad to charge. If you have a case that prevents the pencil from making physical contact with the iPad the pencil will not work. This seems like a pretty significant design flaw on Apple's part. My otter box case is a fantastic case but I cannot charge this pencil with the case so I returned the pencil.,,
Chose wrong product,,
This product wasn’t new as advertised,,
"Apple Pencil was working great. However after a month and a half of using it. It stopped working. Called Amazon support, they were unable to help me and directed me to Apple. Stayed on the phone with Apple support and unfortunately nothing happened. They were also unable to help out.I tried everything from reconnecting my Apple Pencil to my ipads Bluetooth to doing a hard restart. Nothing works.Recently purchased the Ankace pencil for my iPad and am loving it. It also costs a quarter of the price and so far it’s able to keep up with the usage.",,
Dope but not compatible with my ipad. Reading is fundamental but certain folks don't read. Me... I'm certain folks.,,
"Purchased Apple Pencil May 18, 2022. Return window closed one month later. Pencil died (unable to charge) on August 28th.",,
"The charge flat out sucks... I hate how hard the tip is. I had to buy a silicone case and tip, which I have to take off every single day to charge the thing. Multiple times a day... why didn’t Apple make a rubberized tip?! Also- I bought TWO pencils, so I could use one while the other is charging. NOPE! Only one pencil allowed at a time. Ridiculously overpriced and all around just dumb, IMO.",,
Love this pencil. I like how its lightweight and easy to sync up with iPad. Double tap feature is a lot nicer then flipping the whole pencil to erase.BUT the pencil stopped charging! It says 0% all the time. What is going on here? I updated my iPad and everything. It just wont charge no matter what i do.....ugh,,
Received product on time ! Everything was fine but the today i saw that the tip was broken . Didn’t expect that,,
It was already open. ',,
I bought wrong pencil,,
"It has not been a year but I cracked out of blue, not external damage. It's too bad apple doesn't support this type of inconvenience",,
"The pencil I got came broken from Amazon Warehouse deals. They clearly don't check these products before sending them back out. The working Apple Pencil I subsequently bought from Best Buy was absolutely phenomenal. Basically this is a one star review for Amazon, not the product.",,
"Stopped working within a month, was very happy with it until this moment.",,
"Thought I would save a few dollars over ordering direct from Apple, but the money I saved clearly wasn't worth it since this didn't come with replacement nibs, but on Apple's website it says they come with 2 replacement nibs. If I want more nibs, I'll have to fork over $20 more.",,
I have a brand new 9th gen iPad 2021 and it's not very clear in the product listing which generation apple pencil is compatible with which iPad.,,
"This pen works fine, however, I think I received an old item. The tip is green and smells bad. Little disappointed to receive such an item especially for $125.",,
Muy mal,,
Dies fairly quickly I’m out of return time oh well,,
The pen not work in had dirty on it on the phone with you guy and y’all don’t know what going onI bought one from Walmart and never had this problem. now I have a problem with this one,,
I just wasted $133 on a pencil I can’t even use. I read that this pencil works with the new iPad but low and behold it does not. Amazon is now saying I can’t return it even though I received it today (ordered it yesterday). My ipad has the magnetic strip for said pencil but for some reason it is not compatible. Biggest waste of time and money.,,
These pens are being reported defective IN MASSES. Including the one I purchased less than 2 months ago. Apperently they decided to skip any level of quality control when making these pens.,,
It does not come with any type of charger or the adapter,,
It is useless.  I wish I could describe it as more than such.  It presents little to touch.  Little to drawing.  It seems useless to me.,,
Apple Pencil unresponsive to iPad Mini 6th gen,,
"Complete waste of $125 and the pencil wasn’t even new. It had scratches on it and the tip was not on all the way. I could tell it wasn’t new because it didn’t have the plastic wrap that comes on all new Apple products. I spent 3 hours talking to Apple Support trying to figure out what was wrong and the whole time, I had a defective pencil. You’re better off going to your nearest Walmart or electronics store, seriously.",,
"The device stopped working after 2 weeks.  Amazon support was very helpful, but they had to go through Apple support.  I am disappointed that I had to go through this much trouble as this is a brand new pencil and it stopped working.  Even more disappointing as the pencil was a gift.  Spent an hour with Amazon support.  The Amazon support is better than the Apple pencil itself.Amazon sent a second pencil and very soon after the second pencil stopped charging and would not work.  DO NOT buy this product.",,
"Is this ok for an item stated to be as brand new?? The box was damaged, manual bent and the pen just flopping around in the box. If I wanted a preowned so bad I could’ve just clicked on that option instead of BUY NEW.",,
Do not buy. Refurbished. Worked only at the beginning.,,
I’m happy a bit of Apple Pencil cause it worked however I’m disappointed that they never told me that it has three cracks?! It says Used & very good but that not what it mean because of cracks look like it almost broke! Why did you sell it look like broke in first place?,,
"Horrible. This product came without the tip of the pencil, basically useless. I’m very upset that Amazon sold this product in this condition. Apparently when a product is in “good condition” it comes without needed pieces.",,
Pencil should have been new but had already been opened and was chewed up. Would not charge or pair. Stuck with it past the return window.,,
"For $100 bucks, you can have a smaller 'finger' tip for your touch screen.",,
I received it defective which I understand happens sometimes but my refund has been pending for over two weeks ????? What the hell is going on here ???,,
Wasn’t in the Apple plastic cover so immediately that was a red flag and when I went to pull the pen out there was a chip on the pen then to top it off it wouldn’t even connect to my iPad.,,
"I look after all of my Apple equipment - you have to given everything is so sleek it slips out of your hands.  I had no problems with the older ipad and pencil, but for the latest, I am now ordering my 4th.  Crazy.  Eventually in all cases when I near the screen, lines appear all over the place rendering it unusable.Losing hope with Apple products.",,
"this is the 3rd pencil Inhave, they all shorten out, creating burn marks on pencil, AND on iPad!!!",,
"Pen worked fine, but it seems now like it's dead and won't charge.",,
"I returned this item because it wasn’t compatible with my iPad. The item was received on June 10th by the company, and I am still getting charged the Affirm payments.",,
"If it didn’t work correctly, I wouldn’t write a review but the pen was literally broken. This was a refurbished item so I rolled the dice. The top of the pen fell out as I was opening it. Before you sell a refurbished product, you should at least glance at it.",,
"IT CAME USED, there was no sealed or anything? i’m so disappointed, what a waste of money, Id rather but from apple now or i want a refund cuz wtf",,
I was getting a new apple pencil and instead I got a used apple pencil. Box was opened with some scratches. Haven't tried the pencil as much but I didn't want a used one. Fake sell. Be careful.,,
"Works fine, but as usual with Apple products, this pencil is too expensive for what it does, since I doesnt get used much, it's a fancy gadget.",,
The pen didn’t connect with my iPad. I am returning and hopefully getting one that works.,,
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 It does not pair with mine or my daughters iPad. Will be returning and continue using the cheaper stylus I had",,
Did not work or connect to my ipad. Had to take it up to the Apple store and they couldn’t get to connect either,,
"I ordered this a few months back. Recently unboxed it only to find it does not function.  It must be pilot error, but I am usually pretty good.  For the price of the Apple Pencil, it should have been hand delivered by an Apple engineer to explain its operation.",,
"Bought this along with a new iPad, and it turned out to be incompatible. I missed the return window, so now I'm stuck with a useless $100 sticxk. It's stupid that Apple made it incompatible with some new devices.",,
Bad pencil,,
After three months the battery charge is stuck at 5% and the pen will not charge. Tried with two different iPads with the same result.Overpriced junk.,,
"Not New, Pencil box had no cellophane, the protective plastic around the pencil had obviously been taken off and readhered (evidenced by fingerprints present, and the box was ripped.I cannot yet test this to see if it is damaged- awaiting a new iPad Pro - or if it was just opened and then returned. However- this was not in new condition because open does not equal new, and frankly, I don't have the luxury of time to return and replace it. I'm a professor and need this item for virtual chalk talks.",,
You often have to click like 7-8 times just to get a response in a card game. This is not a stylus or even a freebie pen with a rubber end that works every time as the rubber ended pen actually works. It does not make sense as to the purpose of what it is meant to do. If you click into a writeable field it only expects for you to write and then has no idea what you are writing.,,
"I received the pencil and it connects immediately to the I pad. However, the pencil will not charge. I checked to see if the top was loose and tightened it. I have also disconnected it from Bluetooth and added it again, still no charge. Disappointed with the product.",,
This is the 1st generation pencil,,
I’m so disappointed because it stopped working and I’ve only had it for 3 months.  I’ve tried everything and it just won’t work.,,
"I bought an Apple Pencil for my iPad Pro 11 inch. I am surprised and chagrined that it cannot be used for switching apps, making me resort to my thumb, instead of the $125 Pencil.  Other than drawing, the Elyan Stylus which I also purchased through Amazon is superior in every way.",,
I loved the pen while it was working...The pen is unresponsive and makes a noise when I shake it.  Sadly Apple doesn't repair pencils anymore,,
This is not a real apple product and I want my refund NOW!!!!!! It does not connect to my device and packaging is not real apple packaging,,
Could not pair and did not sync with IPad,,
"Item was promised to be brand new, but in a slightly damaged box. However, the item didn't even work! Item wouldn't pair to my ipad (which it is compatible with). On top of all that, there were cosmetic defects when I was promised otherwise. Luckily, I was able to return it but why would they send me a faulty item to begin with? Be wary when purchasing electronic items through amazon",,
It doesn't sync with my ipad air gen. 9,,
Not that I didn’t like the pencil. The pencil looks like it had a sad face instead of straight the box looks like it  got ran over don’t know how what happened but not happy. Been waiting for this item. Got disappointed.,,
"First, the box did not come in plastic. The pencil tip is yellowish… and bent to the side. It will connect to your iPad, but will not work! I can’t believe I bought a fake Apple product!",,
I think it’s overrated. I still get frustrated using it and just end up using my finger.,,
"At first I thought this was a great price for the product but after about a week after the 30 day return policy, the pencil stopped working and connecting to my iPad. Very frustrating since you can’t get a refund or return. Do yourself a favor and order directly from Apple. At least they offer a full year warranty.",,
I did not like it.  I bought this for my Mom and she was disappointed when it stopped working after 3 months.  She was lucky enough to get a replacement from the Apple Store.  Thats what a reputable store sore.  I am not so sure Amazon would have done anything about it.  My Mom quit Amazon.,,
"The product was great but it came missing parts. Don’t like to be a downer but honestly I received the item with missing parts. So if you like to make my day check out Terrybauerarts, google that and leave me your opinion I make coolshit.",,
"Received my Apple Pencil without any sealed packaging. the actual Amazon box was sealed shut, but the Apple Pencil box wasn’t. So disappointed",,
Bought one it didn't even want to charge got a replacement it did the same thing sent them both back JUNK DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEYI did get a refund but still no pencil that works,,
Although the pencil works nice when I received the box it was dirty and didn’t have the plastic wrap and overall looked gross,,
I bought this pencil and warranty expired 30 days after purchase. The pencil stopped working the day after. Apple was unable to help since it was refurbished. Very disappointed with quality of this product.,,
I was very  pencil to use this pencil with my new iPad. I was extremely disappointed when I opened the Apple box to find a fake Apple Pencil that is not compatible with my iPad. I’m contacting the seller for a refund and I will update this review later once I have heard back from the seller.,,
"Purchased this certified refurbished, and received with the stylus type broken, and threading imbedded into the pencil with no way to get out.",,
"Apple Care was not helpful. Wanted to charge me $140 to get it fixed, even though its still under their warranty. Pencil stopped working within one year of usage. Terrible product and company.",,
"The box was open. Pen looks used, I paid full price for this, not sure why they would send me something used, not okay. I’m going to return and get it from the Apple store.",,
Bought it new and it already quit working after 6 months ! How is it better than cheap generic?,,
"I selected ""Condition New"" when searching for and ordering this pencil, but received a hard used and cracked item instead. It works, but it's not what I thought I was paying for. I'm returning it.",,
Very nice so far didn’t realize I needed an Apple Pencil,,
"The only way to charge this pencil is attached to the side of the iPad Pro .I bought a protective cover for my iPad Pro first thing , then realized I have to take it off and on to charge the pencil !If anyone comes up with a way to charge this please put the information out there for all to see .And yes I tried the charger pad it does not work !",,
Glad to know when buying an apple product there isn't much attention to detail. The apple pencil box made it to me opened with the seal broken - just to find the box that is empty.,,
"I decided to buy the ‘like new’ option ($95) because a new piece ($99) was out of stock. Whilst the product worked okay, the item was supposed to only have minor damage to the packaging, whereas the pencil itself showed clear signs of use and wear and tear at the tip, because of which I returned the product.",,
"RETURNED ITEM, TOO EXPENSIVE, BOUGHT LESS EXPENSIVE ONE BUT BETTER",,
Pencil is basically unusable since it will not stay connected,,
Only works on pro products,,
"Bought a like new from ""Amazon Services"" and it is faulty. And because I had stuff going on in my life it's out of the return window. Thank you Amazon for putting me out $100.",,
Happened twice to me..apple have been kind enough to offer me a 3rd for free..I havent been bothered to print the label and drive to ups.. just caught a glimpse of the broken one too...painful purchase..here is to the hopes of a better version 3,,
Magnets are not Strong Enough. Pencil always coming off the side of my iPad,,
I got the pen a month ago and it already fell apart. Now I have to get new tips. It's ridiculous. Very unimpressed.,,
"Mi Apple Pencil se calienta y no se conecta al ipad, no se que hacer para que sirva. Lo tengo hace menos de 2 meses",,
It connects to iPad for 3 min then disconnects. You need to keep putting it in the charging port in order for it to connect.,,
Not sure yet what I need this for.,,
I bought Apple Pencil. I received HP pencil. I hope they solved this issue.,,
The pencil clearly had charging dots and the tip was yellow and faded. Gave this as a christmas gift and had to return it on the day of Christmas eve because I wanted it to be open on the day. Definitely returning this,,
"I purchased a 2nd generation apple pencil in ""used - like new"" condition. However when I received the product it was not working. Not recommended",,
I ordered a new Apple Pencil and I live in Guam so the shipping is 15 dollars plus the already expensive price point and when it got to my house 2 weeks later.  It had already been opened and used.  Tip was all black.  If I buy a new product.  I expect to get a new product.,,

Easy to loose only has magnetic spot on iPad to hold on top.,,
Stopped charging after 2 months and once dead it was completely useless.,,
Pen top broke off. No longer usable,,
Too hard to get on pencil.,,

"Apple Pencil 2nd generation was delivered to my house 2 days ago. Will not connect to my iPad pro 11 inch. Called Apple support, they could not get it to connect. Because I purchased through Amazon and not Apple, I am unable to return for a replacement or refund. Highly dissatisfied!",,
Producto defectuoso,,
It was good then it stopped working it just loads and I don’t know why tired my friends pen on my iPad and it works so it’s not me it’s the pen. Very upset and want a new one my uncle got me it for my birthday and now it’s not working anymore more new in the package I guess that’s up with this.,,
"It is blatantly a counterfeit. See photo, completely different item, unsealed box, typos on printed materials",,
"Purchased for the 12.9 iPad Pro and not only did I have issues with the pen disconnecting, but it also died very quickly. I probably received a defective unit and unfortunately had to return it.",,
Apple Pencil box was not wrapped from the factory. The paperwork inside the box was folded. The pencil it self is stained and looks used. The inside of the box was also dirty.,,
This item is used — not new.,,
It works when it’s connected but it disconnects and I have to restart my whole tablet for it to connect again,,
"I purchased this apple pencil as a Christmas gift for my wife but when she opened and try to set up it would not  charge, you can imagine the great disappointment and to make matter worse i have no support in Barbados this is my second apple product that has arrived dead. I am thinking never to buy an apple product again.",,
It’s a costly toy IMHO,,
Sent back because it wouldn’t pair with iPad and they received it yet never refunded money.  Scam!!!!!!,,
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 It worked properly two days then it stopped working, even though it shows that is connected through Bluetooth it won’t work.",,
It doesn’t work with my iPad even though it states that’s it’s compatible. So disappointed,,
Expensive and can you not use with this iPad.,,
I ordered this product NEW and was sent one that was clearly repackaged - it was missing the plastic cover and the tip of the pencil was loose and broken. It could not be detected by my iPad screen. I had to send it back. I think this one is on Amazon and not Apple because I’ve used Apple Pencils before and they’re usually pretty good.,,
Nothing is wrong with the pencil but I find it isn’t that important to my use of the iPad. A keyboard would have been more useful,,
hate to pay apple prices but no choice,,
"I had for 2 weeks and the pencil had stop working, it was fully charged and still didn’t work. Not worth it just go to apple store and get the real deal.",,
Dead on arrival. Doesn't charge or pair. Instructions are thin and shows a button feature that doesn't exist on the product. The magnetic charging is annoying if you have a case on your iPad. I ordered 1st generation instead. If the next one doesn't work I'm buying a knock off brand rather than overpriced Apple brand.,,
"I never write reviews, but this has to be a joke! I got scammed!! Everything looked good and then I opened the box and realized it was a fake pen. Don’t buy this!!",,
I got mine today. The box was opened. None of it wrapped in any kind of plastic. The Apple Pencil was clearly used before. Very unsatisfactory.,,
"If not in use, the battery fully drains in 24 hours.",,
"I love your product, I've had it since Dec. 5th. Just recently it started loosing its charge and I don't know if it's me or if the pencil is not a good one.",,
Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t. It lags a lot and sometimes the pen randomly turns off by itself. I have to constantly readjust to get it to write.,,
did not like it did not work  even after i tried 3 of tnem,,
Limited functionality for university studentsDiscoloring quickly into a yellow ish,,
"In order to make previous technology even more useless, Apple does not allow this pencil to work with older versions of the iPad.  Why they wouldn’t be able to have it work at a baseline function with older technology is maddening. Returned this immediately and purchased the first generation pencil again. Which still functions wonderfully!",,

This product came and it did not work at all.,,
Bought it 6 months ago. Already not holding a charge. Now it won’t even take a charge.,,
The box had something dirty on it. Box was already open and seemed already used. No film on apple pencil. Waste of time. Don’t buy.,,
Received a pencil that wouldn’t work or fully charge. With no way to return through Amazon. The return form just says ineligible for return. I’ll buy my apple products from a more reputable source such as E B A Y from now on…,,
"Did not work, defective, also this seller has apparently sold fake pens, and finally apple does not honor their 1 year warranty when purchased through Amazon...just dont",,
Not good. Defective didn’t work at all! Horrible product,,
Horrible quality control on Amazon’s part. Bought second gen and opened box and the 1st gen pencil is in there—doesn’t even fit in the box properly. Will be returning ASAP and just buying the pencil straight from Apple. Do not buy Apple products from amazon,,
"Amazon recommended the newest Apple Pencil, which I bought.  Turns out it does not work with the 10.5 and smaller screens.  Needs the Gen.1 pencil.  Does not work with the IPad Pro 10.5.  I have been sitting here since then trying to get it to work, and now the exchange period has ended.  Ne humans to discuss, and Apple says it is an Amazon issue.",,
"Be careful this is not a second generation pencil even though it is listed and priced as though it is.Had to return and go to local Apple Store. It became a disappointing birthday present for my granddaughter.I had to put out another 130.00 and am awaiting refund on this one. Again be careful, false advertising.",,
Buen producto no se entrego en la fecha ofrecida,,
Buy this if you want a product that will never work !,,
It's over priced and they can't even include 1 extra nib. I bought an ipad purely for how cheap procreate is. Otherwise an ipad is utterly useless compared to pc and android possibilites. Apple is not a good company. Any other pen/stylus would include an extra tip. Just not the lame apple corporation that's bent on ripping people off for limited products,,
"This was working fine and suddenly it won’t pair with my iPad 11. In fact, it’s not detectable by any Bluetooth device. And yes, it’s charged - so far as we know, there’s no way to communicate with it or tell what’s going on. No lights, plugs, read outs which looks cool, but what if it.... stops working? Brilliant.",,
This isn’t for phones like I though. At the time the description did not say that. Maybe it does now. This is only for the Apple tablet I’m assuming.,,
I got this in November and 5 months later it is already dead.,,
Item did not come shrink wrapped or have any plastic to peel off inside box.,,
It broke within 2 monthsSomething like this should not break so soonIt would nice to get a replacement,,
I got a fake off brand $12 stylus. I saw other reviews of people saying the same thing. Be careful.,,
"How is this information not front and center for the pencil?  Will not work with an iPhone, at all!!!  Very frustrated with this purchase.",,
"Do not buy from Amazon! I bought the Apple Pencil and it the box wasn’t sealed and when I opened it the pencil was scuffed, chipped, and had crusty stuff on it. Disgusting!",,
"You need this pen for the iPad if you use it for procreate. The knock offs wont compare. but of course it’s sold separately, Cost way too much, and easily breaks if you drop it. Thanks apple. Another $150 down the drain for a replacement and extra tips since those break too.",,
"Apple Pencil is a great concept, and when it works, it is awesome. However, this pencil stopped working within a month of having it and this item is not available for returns. What a waste of $110.",,
"This pencil is probably fine for drawing or casual notes, but for real, business note-taking, it is AWFUL. It’s a gimmick, a joke. I returned it immediately. And I really wanted it to work. I wanted to like it, because it would have improved my filing and organization.",,
Product does not work,,
"The item was listed new, but I clearly received a used Apple Pencil. No plastic wrap inside and no shrink wrap on the package. The pencil was dirty. The user manual was inserted upside down and had crease marks and dents. This product was not accurately described and listed.",,
Pencil was received with missing parts and does not work.,,
"photo taken moments after delivery. the tip is not smooth- has a plastic seam or defect. when using on iPad screen, causes light scratches.",,
"Pencil didn't work at all.  Charged fine but the iPad never saw it.  Returned, and my return was lost in transit.",,
"Apparently the new pencil is only compatible with iPad Pro. Luckily, the 1st Gen is still available online…",,
Pretty useless . I don’t ever use it.,,
I bought a “Used- Like New” Apple Pencil and it came with tons of scuffs. I would have keep it but it also arrived without a tip. It would not write or connect to my iPad 11 pro. Disappointed.,,
"Pencil stopped working in less than 90 days, called Amazon for support and I was told to contact Apple support; which didn't help.  I don't want to buy another pencil if the lifespan of the product is less than 90 days. Amazon never offered me an exchange or my money back. Frustrating!",,
"Extreme excitement to have bought this in connection to the release of the new iPad Air (2020), but when we tried to draw, it connects but it does not scribble or draw anything. Now, I need to return this and waiting for the replacement. Hope the next one doesn't have my hopes up.",,
"I buy it for my daughter's Christmas gift, she does not really use it often,  in the middle of March, the pen not work, I Contact amazon, they said should contact the seller, I send the seller message, after one week, nobody answers me.",,
Literally opened an empty box there was no Apple Pencil anywhere in sight 😒,,
"don’t buy this pen. There is no return policy and for what reason?!? We bought the wrong pen and now are stuck with $100 pen that has no use. Good job Amazon, that’s complete sarcasm.",,

The pencil didn’t work I even bought new tips hoping that it would work but it still doesn’t I won’t be buying anymore used apple products anymore I’ve learned my lesson,,
Overpriced! Worked for 6 months and then quit holding a charge. Found cheaper substitutes that I still am using. Not impressed with the Apple Pencil.,,
Does not work,,
This is not a negative review of the product itself but the seller. It was a bit misleading as I received a product that looks opened and I can’t find a warranty for it.,,
Arrived in packaging and didn't work went through troubleshooting methods and no luck. A joke considering the product is priced at $99.,,
The pencil came already opened. The box was unsealed and the pencil wouldn’t connect to my son’s iPad Air 4th generation.,,
When I was buying this item it said brand new but it was a use item and now it's not connecting to my daughter's iPad,,
Product came unsealed didn’t work and was missing parts… i went to Walmart bought the same pencil and it worked just fine.,,
"Sold by Amazon.com, received on time with Prime. No plastic wrap, the sliding box inside was the wrong direction. Otherwise the product was fine. I might just keep it if I had not paid the full price for a brand new item.",,
"I purchased this only to find it only works across a few systems. Google Docs, for example, is where I get most of my work done and where I needed to use it the most. You cannot use it in Google Docs. The few Apple Pencil on-screen tools that pop up in Google Docs (and which are pretty pointless) actually get in the way. I can see needing it if you take a lot of notes or are an artist. Otherwise, it doesn't do anything your finger or a keyboard couldn't do and is actually a hassle.",,
"Ordered 2. One works great, second one wasDead on arrival. Despite promises of exchanges neither Amazon nor Apple can process an exchange. Will be talking to my credit cardCompany.",,
"It feels good and writes great but it can't hold its charge for more than a day. It only lasts about 14 hours,  so I have to charge it every day",,
Broke after only 2 months. Have to go to apple to return.,,
Order this Apple Pencil and it didn’t come with a tip. How am I suppose to use the damn pencil without a tip?,,
Please do not buy from this seller. I bought an Apple Pencil 2nd gen and it did not pair with my IPad. I now have to return it and get a refund,,
Sold item which stopped to work in 3 month. Apple declined warranty because can't verify the serial number or purchase date. Lost money!,,
The title says it all. Very surprised that my iPad isn’t recognizing this pencil anymore after only a few weeks. Very disappointed.,,
Very bad,,
It lags so bad that it’s unusable. My return window just closed and I’m screwed. This pencil sucks. And it’s not that program it’s the pencil.,,
didn’t connect at all to my ipad 11 pro,,
"it worked for a few months and now it won't connect to my iPad. I've restarted the iPad, forgot the apple device in Bluetooth settings and it pops up to connect but won't actually connect to the iPad.",,
Rip off. By Apple controlling their market and forcing us to purchase something,,
It had a missing tip and it has a broken top so i can't just replace the tip,,
"My pen did not work. When I contacted Apple for assistance they informed me that the pen was old, and defective. It would not connect with my iPad Pro (2nd Generation) even after hours of help from Apple. I sent the pen back.",,
"was non functional, would not charge, would not pair, I spent three  hours of my day off trying to get it to work finally amazon help put me through to apple, it wiil take anther two weeks to get a replacement......",,
"I dislike when someone is selling used items as new ones. Package opened, box damaged.",,
"I purchased this item because I also ordered the new iPad. Since the iPad order got canceled, this pen is useless because it can only be charged with the iPad. Had I known this, I would have never ordered it.",,
"Pencil broken, it doesn’t connect with my new ipad",,
Stopped working the day after my 60 day return window closed…very unsatisfied,,
"I thought I was buying a 2nd Gen apple pencil but I instead received an old 1st gen apple pencil, the description clearly said 2nd Gen so I'm not sure why i got that instead.",,
"Dicen que se entregó directamente a un residente, no es cierto, hemos visto por la cámara como el paquete es clavado en los pinchos de la reja, de noche, y una persona con un pañuelo cubriéndole la cabeza se lo lleva, por lo tanto no he recibido mi paquete!",,
Don’t know what happened. This product does not work. Tried videos online to determine how to charge and link to Bluetooth. No joy.,,
$100 for a stylus? Seriously. Works like the 5 dollar ones in the store just this one needs a charge,,
I have bought this for my iPad but the pencil did not work!!!,,
"Caro y al final no sirve sólo para cierta tablet y no funciona en otras, buena para dibujar, pero qué sea tan caros para que sólo funcione en una en expecico, increíble.",,
this product did not work on my ipad -- and it was a gift that I didn't give until after the return date.  will NOT buy from this seller again!!!  too short a return time!!!!,,
I was really looking forward to using the Pencil regularly. It’s more than a year it’s not working and all it is now is an elongated paperweight! Truly disappointed ☹️,,
The media could not be loaded.,,
The pen refused to work after 3 months.,,
"Not properly worked with ipad pro so, I got refurbished through Apple service center.",,
"This wasn’t a real apple product. It connected via blue tooth and not the instant apple connection and didn’t work on my iPad. Such a waste of time and money, again this is a fake apple product DO NOT BUY!!!!",,
"Ordered Nov 12,2019, it’s now April 08, 2020 and it’s stopped working.Apple support is no help, it just guides us to help topics, not someone who can help. Something like this shouldn’t stop working after less than 6mo.Who is supposed to fix this for us? The return window has closed.......",,
Had to waist time going to Apple to find out the pen they list as compatible with Generation 2 Ipad Pro does not!  I would like to get paid for my wasted time.  Now they want me to pay for the ship back  Go pound rocks.  Don't buy from them,,
I with the tip was sharp. For this much money it better fn work. But underwhelming for its price,,
When I received this Apple Pencil I was so excited and then it never worked. I hope I can exchange it!,,
Newest apple pencil. Newest apple iPad. Not compatible. Wtf,,
"Used my pen only a few times and then it stopped working, wouldn’t reconnect to iPad. Apple would not exchange. Do not recommend.",,
"Product will not charge, can't seem to process a refund or return online.",,
"unboxed and tried to use, wasnt working so unscrewed tip to see what was up. the yellow stick part was broken off in the nib. how this passed certification is beyond me.",,
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Defective item. This is definately not properly certified as renewed or refurbished",,
"The box I received was not sealed, like how everything is seal from Apple. The Pen itself also comes in a certain wrap and it was not sealed.This was an open box, literally the papers feel out the second I took it out. Not like amazon at all, very disappointed.",,
Wasn't compatible even though your description said it was.,,
I bought 2 my twins needed them for school and neither one had the pencil inside! Box looks official with insert but no product..this is ridiculous,,
Didn’t last a month.,,
The one I got came broken-chipped at the nub and paired with iPad but would not drawBoth this shipment and the replacement delayed,,
"the apple pencil is great. if you buy the refurbished one, they send you a jacked up one and do t apologize for it. bot worth getting refurbished.",,

bad no good money down the drain work for 3 month and then nothing will not charge will not connect.,,
Got the wrong version for the ipad I own.,,
Stopped working,,
Purchased this in mid August and it worked fine until today (mid Oct).  Pencil wont pair or charge or anything was awesome while it lasted but I’ve never seen an apple device go bad so quickly.,,
"Unfortunately, I received the first generation Apple Pencil instead of the second generation pencil.  I double-checked, and the outside bubble wrap sticker clearly says, ""Second Generation,"" but the pencil is a first generation and won't work with my iPad Pro.  Frustrating.",,
"Compatible ONLY with the third generation of iPad Pro. The description says that it is compatible with the 3rd generation, but nothing indicates that it is ONLY compatible with the 3rd generation or that it is not compatible with prior generations.",,
I think it’s compatible with all IPads.,,
I found out that what came inside the box was not an apple product. I am so mad right now that I want to return the iPad too.,,
My pencil came without a tip! Paid way too much for this to not be a complete product!!!,,
Waiting for refund.,,
I returned two items - an ipad and this. I mixed the labels up and tried contacting them so now they have my ipad and wont return it to me so I can return it to correct facility.,,

 My Apple Pencil came without the outer shrink wrap, and was cracked on the side… I don’t know if it was a used one?",,
No Apple guarantee on this product.,,
Will have to go to Apple as so faf can’t get it to pair,,
Pencil pairs to iPad. Does not write. Bought new tips. Still doesn’t work.,,
"Quality is good, but it's overpriced. Wait for a sale if you can.",,
The apple pencil did not work as advertised. It would not pair with my iPad Pro 11. It would not write. I sent it back. Amazon refunded my credit card payment in the form of an Amazon credit.,,
Came with the battery depleted and couldn’t get it to charge at all. Returned and purchased directly from Apple,,
I only rated one star because I had too! I received my Apple Pencil box today without the APPLE PENCIL!!! I’m furious !,,
This 2nd generation Apple pencil is not better than the 1st generation.  It only works with a few of the newer Apple products (iPad Pro 12.9‑inch (3rd generation) & iPad Pro 11‑inch).  Most people will want the 1st generation.,,
Worked for about 2 weeks then crap. We got a new one somewhere else and it’s that one is great,,
I just received the box for my pen and their was no plastic wrap over the box.  I looked in the box and everything was their except for the pen.  I need someone to fix this problem.,,
"Forced to give it a star to write the review- extremely disappointed in Amazon, the audacity to put the the “inspected” by Amazon sticker yet there was not actual pen!",,
"Apple Pencil dejo de funcionar, ya no conecta. Sólo aparecen esos avisos. Decepcionado estoy",,
"No on is vetting these pencils, I received two broken dead pencils.",,
"The tip of the pen is bent, and return policy is non existent.",,
Not fair must right kind ipad,,
Product was used! Even the tip of the pencil was dirty. Just buy direct from Apple.,,
I received a dog chewed Pencil.,,
"Opened the box but no pen, its missing. Pls assist I have never had this issue before",,
Took two weeks to get to me. Turns out it was refurbished and didn’t even work. Had to return it. Went to Target and bought a new one for only $7 more and it worked perfectly.,,
Pen stopped working I’m very disappointed,,
The pencil does not connect does not work,,
"Apple pencil wasn't in the box... box of pencil came open, without the pencil in it",,
Purchased what was suggested and it will not pair,,
Touchscreen and accuracy rate is so low due to poor tip and pencil condition,,
"Wow, what a disappointment this product is. I paid $130 up front. It is now completely bricked (confirmed by online customer support and genius bar appointment). No explanation why. If you read the myriad of help articles online you will see various explanations related to the users failure to keep the pen charged at all times. While no one ever warned me of that, I can assure you that my pencil stayed clipped to the magsafe charger on the ipad at all times. I also never did anything else to the pencil that would explain it’s sudden failure.I used this pencil occasionally for work to take notes. ~1-2 times per week. Very light usage overall. It was working totally normally less than a week before it’s complete demise.As a product the pencil does its job well enough. I can’t point to anything extraordinary. It is better than a stylus, but not significantly different than its more modern competitors. I was happy to pay $130 for a product a presumed would be functional for a reasonable lifetime, however with so many reports of early failures (days/weeks outside of warranty), the value is just not there.Apple offers only a $20 credit for a bricked magic pencil 2. That means they expect me to pay another $110 for a replacement pencil after mine failed in marginally over a year. Completely unacceptable. I have already begun my migration away from apple, and after this failure I will only accelerate my efforts. I will not be replacing this pencil. I will not replace this ipad when it dies. In all likelihood I will not even purchase another iPhone.",,
"I used this every once in a while, and treated it with care, yet the day the warranty expires, it becomes less responsive. Then four days after the warranty expired, it bearly registers any touch at all!",,
"Tuve la terrible experiencia de comprar algo de apple por amazon y vino roto y sin funcionamiento. Lo peor, nunca más compraría por aquí algo de apple, mejor iré directamente a la página.",,
The Apple Pencil works fine but I noticed that the tip has metal showing. So it scratches across my screen when I use it. I’m not sure who to contact to get a replacement tip.,,
"I had this specific item in my wishlist, which one of my fans purchased new for me. It arrived at the very last minute and, upon opening, I found that the box was scuffed and marked up. I opened it and found that the pen was crooked and dirty (I wiped it down before taking the picture), and the nib was bent. Well, I tried to use the thing on my tablet, which is also brand new, and it did connect, but was utterly unresponsive for any function. It did not register any strokes, it will change modes... just nothing. It didn't even register on the setup. I have spare nibs and made to change it. But when I twist it off, and very gently, mind you, it broke apart at the threads, which are now stuck in the pen. The little brass bit is scratched, scuffed, dented and bet. Even if my fan bought it as used, which he said he didn't, this thing was completely broken and in totally unacceptable condition.",,

"Pencil was broken on arrival. The tip was also worn completely through, so not refurbished at all. Scam.",,
"Very disappointed! The pencil tip is flat. It has no point to write with.  I’m not sure why as other family members are happy with the purchase. Maybe I received a used one, not sure.",,
"The box I received was not sealed, like how everything is seal from Apple. The Pen itself also comes in a certain wrap and it was not sealed. Clearly used product.",,
Returning the product,,

Apple needs to make things to work with all of their products.,,
It works totally fine but the double tap feature went out. I talked to Amazon and there was nothing they could do so Apple would replace it for $115.00.,,

Does not work.,,
"Doesnt work, dont buy",,
Definitely not happy!,,
This is not an apple pencil 2. Its a scam.,,
"It took quite a bit of research after my Apple Pencil died to figure out that it is incapable of recharging once the battery has depleted one time.  If you constantly use it and never let the battery level drop, you may be fine, but if you would only be an occasional user and plan on ever storing it, you will find yourself with a paperweight.  Actually, it would make a terrible paperweight because when it did work, I found that it rolled away every chance it got; the one flat edge does nothing to stop that.  It's also very difficult to keep that flat edge where you want it in your hand for tapping on, which was a huge headache.",,
The item order was the WRONG PRODUCT. Item ordered should have been Apple pencil 7th generation.,,

Does not work on 2017 iPad Pro.  I feel like this should have been made more clear.,,
Eh,,
"in apple pencil box, but a fake 3d pencil was in the box",,
"Now, for one thing, you should really buy these from Apple’s website, but anyway…I used the first-generation for years, and it was practically perfect. It rarely ever acted up. This, however, is total garbage. While it is super convenient to charge it directly onto your iPad, the double-tap to switch between pencil and eraser is SUPER touchy, and is CONSTANTLY getting in my way! For another thing, the tracking is absolute trash. There will be times when I’m using, say, a pencil brush in an art app, (and these sorts of pens/apps have a feature that if you slant the pen, the brush will flatten and widen like if you used the side of a real pencil) but for some reason, even when I’m holding my pen perfectly upright and straight, it thinks that it should act as though it’s slanted, and so, instead of a neat, straight line, I get a barf of thick, wobbly lines that I constantly have to undo. And this goes for every single brush I use! The cursor (as it were) will jump to the side, or curve, or goodness knows what else! I don’t know if this is some sort of “new design feature” or what, but it only serves to give me a headache and waste my time. If you can avoid it, I would not purchase a second-gen Apple Pencil. First gen is all you need.",,
The product never worked no matter how I tried to connect it.,,
Defective right out of the box. Wouldn’t pair or charge.,,
Do not buy!!!! Warranty sucks and amazon is no help!!!!,,
Did not like,,
Didn’t get a sealed product. It was open box and used,,

Can’t charge or use on my iPad,,
Not compatible my iPad Pro so I am in process of returning it.,,

It only works with iPad Pro!,,
"My new Apple Pencil did not work, only recording about 50% of my marks or writing. I followed all instructions, used the online tutorials, sought help from Apple Support. But it was just a lemon. Apple sent me another. We will see how it works. Must be a common problem: Apple did not even want me to return the defective pencil.",,
Garbage,,
It stopped working,,
"It would be a 5-star review if you could charge the pencil without the iPad! Yes, iPad and iPencil go hand in hand BUUUUUUUUUT if you have an iPad case that does not have a place for the iPencil then you will add yourself some more work by taking the case off, attaching the iPencil as designed, charging it and then putting the case back on. I mean cool idea, Apple, but there absolutely should be a way to charge the 2nd pencil w/o having to magnetically attach it to the iPad (just like Gen 1).PRO: Everything except for the CON below :|CON: It would be a perfect pen IF you could charge the damn thing without attaching it to the iPad!",,
This pen cost me $30 more through Apple. I did not research the market. Now I am sad.,,
"I had pencil for about a year and it was really nice. I do draw on my iPad so it was a great thing to have. It was convenient to have it attach magnetically and it worked well.However, one day recently it just didn't work. The pencil stopped pairing and will not charge anymore.  Apple won't replace it because it is out of warranty of course. Apple wanted more than I paid to fix it as well. I am pretty upset a 130 dollar (I paid 120 then) stylus died in a year but debating on a new one.Apple support did verify with me though that there is a known issue (which they don't seem to warn people on) that if these pencil's die and are not charged soon after, it will kill the pencil's battery. I do believe this is what happened to mine. With that said, don't take the chance.. keep it charged.  Hopefully this helps someone out.",,
It came in bad conditions and i can’t conected with my ipad pro 12.9 inches,,
"It works, with good accuracy but I personally hate writing on an iPad.It’s great to sign documents, annotate , but it stops there as far as I’m concerned.",,
"Liked:*East to pair with the iPad.*Functionality is very good and precise.*Feels ""pretty"" good in my hand.*Charges quickly and maintains a good charge for all tasksDid not like:*The magnetic holder fails and can come loose and be separated from the iPad*Too fragile.  I have broken two transducers inside the tip due to an accidential drop, causing me to replace  the whole pencil at over a hundred bucks.Would like to see:*Apple needs to replace some of the plastic inner parts with metal, or something more substancial.*A flat side on the pencil, meant to stop the pencil from rolling, does not work and needs to be redesigned.*Put a cap on the tip (similar to a real pen) for extra protection.Overall:  Would not recommend due to the high cost and fragility.",,
not connecting to ipad… battery doesn’t even show up when attached,,
"It’s a solid product and it gets features upgrades from time to time, but the magnet isn’t strong enough and it can get lost very easily! Or fall down from the iPad and break!",,
"Misses things, doesn’t alway connect right away and can be finicky. But, it’s still an Apple Pencil and I love it. Lovely satin finish, nice little flat edge, connects to charger well and is very handy in all my applications. Not much more to say about it, really. It’s a fancy stylus.",,
"Bought an iPad pro last month. With that the inevitability of buying an apple pencil 2. The pencil works great and there is a good integration with the Apple ecosystem, but the price. It's absurd. 130$ for a damn pencil, that sucks but as a college student with note-taking needs, I have no alternatives but to buy this one. The added epiphany is in my case I have to replace my apple pencil tips every two months as I use a paper-like screen protector (4 months for no screen protector scenario). If you are running short of budget, I would suggest you buy a third party apple pencil which does the job decent enough.",,
"I bought an IPad specifically for art and illustration purposes and for the price of the Apple Pencil, both 1 and 2, Apple should at least include a set of extra tips! After occasional use of the pencil 2 for the past 2 months my pencil tip is wearing out exposing the metal underneath the plastic covering. That shouldn’t be happening at all. Other than that, with some connectivity issues here and there, the pencil does work well! When it works so buyer beware.",,
"I have seen a lot of reviews over the two major types of styluses that people talk about.  I have both.  I have had the Pencil on my 12.9 iPad Pro and now on my 11"" 2018 iPad Pro model.  The last version was very responsive, but really, really clunky to use.  Too long and the battery life was horrible.  This newer version is better, but still has horrid battery life and loses connectivity, frequently.  Apple solved both of these by reconnecting the device every time you recharge it, which is good.  No other company could get away with this kind of experience.By comparison, the stylus on my Surface Pro 6 has a natural level of friction on the screen, but the response rate isn't as fast.  That said, the battery life and connection reliability are WAY ahead of the Apple Pencil 2.  It never loses connection and the battery life is more like 2 years than 2 days, like the Pencil.  Yes, I know that the MS one uses a battery, but so what.  The battery lasts forever, does more than the Pencil and costs less.  Hard to give the Pencil a great value rating.",,
"I bought this for for my high school daughter who is doing school through distance learning on her IPad Pro (12.9” 2020).  It literally rolled off her desk and fell 2.5 feet and the tip (plastic and metal internal piece) broke off on falling. After spending $1100 on the iPad Pro and $129 on the pencil 2, I web chatted with Apple and then talked to some one at a local Apple store (who seemed more interested in logging in’s my conversation into an iPad than talking to me). Their response: “ did you buy the $120 insurance on the iPad? If not, then go away, I can’t help you, next.” Seriously. I have a hard time writing this owning countless Apple products and owning a good amount of their stock, but this is awful. I expect more. Either build better products or stand behind theme better. I will likely buy an off market brand as it can not be worse. Thanks Apple (said sarcastically), you customer support will make you become the next IBM (who? Exactly!).",,
"I am very dissapointed in my Apple pencil. I did buy it from Best Buy, not Apple but wanted to warn others of a major defect.  It worked well and always paired but after two months I dropped it from TWO feet and the tip broke off!  When it broke off the bottom ring was wedged into the base of the pencil and could not be removed.  I reported it to Apple and they said that ""the pencil was not made to withstand ANY drop"".  Seriously, who doesn't drop a pencil or stylus from time to time?  I will not be replacing my pencil if they can not make something more durable than this.",,
"This product has been endlessly frustrating since it first stopped working after a month of minimal use.Even when the Pencil is connected to my iPad via Bluetooth, has full charge, and a brand new nib (tightly fastened), on a freshly cleaned screen, it just doesn't work. It does not register on the screen at all. I even tried removing the Paperlike screen protector I got in case that would get it to register again. No luck.I was able to get it working following some of the above methods once or twice (particularly tightening the nib), but it just goes back to broken the same day.Clearly, there's something wrong with the hardware itself, but I bought this from an actual Apple Store for $130, which are unfortunately closed now due to the pandemic, so I can't even find a replacement.I would never recommend something so expensive and so faulty to anyone.",,
Scam Alert! when it arrive the box looks kinda legit until you start to find all the spelling errors and the Apple Pencil is one of those cheap touch screen soft tip pencils.,,
This is a used apple pen. It is not new. I am so disappointed when receiving it.,,
"Here is a tidbit Apple doesn't bother sharing. If you don't use the pen and charge it regularly, it will die and not be able to be recharged. The amount of time can vary from 1-3 months, but if you forget to or don't need to use it for that amount of time, you basically have a ridiculously overpriced model of a pen that is useless in all ways. Disappointing that it costs so much, disappointing that Apple doesn't warn you or use a different battery (other than li-ion) that doesn't have this problem, and disappointing that Apple doesn't replace these seriously flaws pens or have an option to fix them.",,
I just purchased my first pencil last week and was looking forward to using it on my new iPad Pro. But upon opening it I found that it would not charge or pair with my iPad. I spent the next couple of days trying different things to troubleshoot but nothing worked. I let the pencil sit overnight charging to another iPad and it simply wouldn’t work. So then I contacted amazon and explained the situation to them and they sent another pencil. I just opened it a few hours ago and so far it’s the same problem. Now I’m going to have to call and schedule an appointment to get it fixed. What an awesome paperweight!,,
Only compatible with an iPad Pro 11 and 13 (according to a video seen on YouTube). Pairing instructions were very obscure. Had to return and purchase the 1st generation,,
"Item was listed as “Like New”. The box was like new but the 2nd Generation Apple Pencil had scratches, unidentifiable goo, and a dull point. It would not work with my iPad Pro.",,
"I bought a 2nd gen pencils and it was amazing and beautiful. But i dropped it to the lanolin floor, from about 3 feet high. After i tried to use it on my ipad, it would disconnect and connect. It stoped working after a while and it only connects sometime now but it doesn't work. It also show ""2%"" battery after 5 minutes of being disconnected. I had this pencil for 3 days",,
"Just received this as a birthday present with a brand new iPad Pro 11. The pencil will not charge right out of the brand new box and it won’t work with the iPad. After reading reviews I’m confused as to whether or not this pencil even works with this iPad as the questions answered  says it only works with the third generation iPad Pro. Others say it works with the ipad i have. My iPad was just purchased with the pencil, the iPad works great but this pencils a piece of crap. You’re better off buying the cheaper versions. Hugely disappointed with apple yet again....",,
"Alas, the Apple Pencil 2 appears to be defective.  If you go onto other review sites, including Apple’s, you will see that many people have experienced problems pairing the Pencil 2 with the third general iPad, the only iPad with which this device is designed to work.  I have tried unsuccessfully with three different very helpful Apple Support personnel to remedy, and tried TWO different pencils.  Other boards show hundreds of people have this precise issue.  So my advice to Apple is to fix this product right away, as people are spending $120 on a pencil which seems ridiculous if it is not going to work.",,
"All advertising says this pencil works with iPad 6.When it didn’t, I got in touch with Apple help.They told me the pencil is NOT compatible with iPad 6.BOO. Bah Humbug….no merry Christmas here. ☹️",,
I think this one is expensive.,,
I have another pencil to my ipad pro 2020 and I think it works even better than this for less than a half of the price.,,
"The description says it’s compatible with all types of iPhones but will only charge with the iPad Pro. That’s absolute crap. The first generation has a Male lightning connection, and this one has nothing.",,
The device never paired properly with my iPad. I bought a generic one and it worked like a charm! Not really worth the extra expense.,,
Wasn’t a real Apple Pencil. Really disappointed.,,
I love apple products and I usually get them off Amazon.with my Apple Pencil it’s been 2 weeks since I got it and it won’t work I called Apple support and they said there is no reason why it shouldn’t work and the charging pop up won’t show so Amazon is sending me a new one and I have to return my old one at kohl’s,,
"If the pencil sits for period of time with 0 charge could be a week or two, the battery fails and cannot be recharged at all- the whole pencil must be replaced.I bought it new, used it a few times, misplaced it for a few weeks and now it will not charge at all.",,
"Don’t buy this product from Apple.  The pencil?  Great while it works.  Mine stopped working a couple weeks out of warranty, and Apple has no repair program.  They just charge you $109 to replace it, plus $10 shipping, plus the amount to send your broken one back.  So I have a $130 piece of trash.  At least have an option to repair your products when they’re faulty.",,
"It's a stylus for the iPad. Honestly, this is the most disappointing Apple has ever put out. Sure it's accurate and responsive, but it is a STYLUS. I get that everything Apple puts out is expensive, even if it is crap, but this is terrible. I was hoping for something more, and was left disappointed. I have a stylus with a fine point that does the same thing, and doesn't cost half as much.",,
Sent it back.Bluetooth is Bluetooth. Why should Apple make a simple adapter for the original Pencil when they know they can charge $130 for a whole new model that brings nothing revolutionary to the table?I love apple products but paying this is ridiculous profit gouging.,,
Calling tech support because it is not working. Only had it a month!,,
"Gave the IPad Pro and Apple pencil to my graduate student daughter. After less than a week’s use, one side of the pencil developed a “nodule” which prevents the pencil from working on that side. Thus us an expensive product and it is a defective one if this is the result after minimal usage! I am a loyal Apple and Amazon customer but this has diminished my respect for both.",,
Rolled of my couch after owning it for 2 months and it stopped working. Very flimsy for such an expensive item. Apple could not fix it and refused to replace it as their warranty doesn’t cover falls. Very disappointed.,,
Pencil did not work. Brought it to Apple store. They tried to get it to sync with iPad and keyboard. Would not sync. The Apple store replaced it for me. I am still awaiting my two year warranty. I paid for it but did not receive it.,,
"As you can see, this product failed. I would like to know how to get it fixed, and don't think I should have to buy another. If I do, it won't be from this vendor. Return window closed, but I still want if fixed.",,
"I will not  buy this pencil when i buy a new I pad due to the 1 star reviews.Seriously, no way to justify.",,
"Anytime you touch the iPad screen it auto starts to draw! It’s useless in excel, why couldn’t apple put a stylus cap or a stylus on the other end or make an option to turn off the automatic drawing when it’s not needed! This is a major flaw, and needs to be fixed ASAP!",,
Doesn’t connect to my iPad Pro anymore,,
Buyers should know what they are buying is being shipped from China!!!!..wait. wait.  wait,,
"I bought got the first generation pencil and the second generation comes out not much later. I wish I had the easier charge feature but not willing to buy another VERY expensive device.  Perhaps I’ll just wait on the third gen device.Should not be long, eh?",,
Stopped working after a few months.,,
I bought a apple case for my apple pencil when I went to put it in wouldn't fit and then when I try to take it out it destroyed  the pencil itself,,
"Not worth the money. Just a stylus and no other use. That’s all...no more, no less!",,
The worst Apple Pencil after 1 year doesn’t work anymore Pure Garbage don’t buy it anymore,,
I can't figure out how to add lead. I think I got a defective pencil... It won't write.,,
It's just a stylus. Who tf spends money this poorly....,,
"Make an Ipad Pencil out of tinfoil, it works just as well as a bought one/",,
Price to high.,,
"The pen works great for art or writing,  but that’s about it,  with the 5th edition iPad Pro with no home button it will not swipe up from the bottom to change apps,  or if you try to use it as a plain stylus  pen to navigate through or operate regular apps it fails.  You may be able to open a app from the Home Screen but then it will write inside that app and you can not close the app by swipe with the pencil. I’m a little shocked that apple did not come up with a rubber tip for the opposite side of the pencil to correct the issue.  I spoke with apple extensively and there is no present correction for this issue so a return is being processed",,
"I ordered two NEW 2nd Gen pencils. One of them showed up clearly a previously opened and then re-wrapped in what amounts to a sandwich bag. For 130 bucks, that's kind of a slap in the face. Buy these local, or Apple direct. This is not the kind of thing you want to order from Amazon's zero accountability, fly-by-night vendors. It's too expensive and too easy to superficially counterfeit. Who knows where it's been or what it's been used for...what if the previous owner was an itchy fella?!? Best case scenario is it's counterfeit and the battery is not a dangerous knockoff.  Well I guess best case scenario is Amazon valuing their customers, but you know.The one that was not previously opened and used works fine. I'm not touching the other one.",,
"Less than two months after purchase it has stopped working completely. Amazon chucked all the blame on Apple and Apple is saying Amazon should have accepted the return after I reported the physical defect. Waiting to hear back from Apple if they’re going to CHARGE ME for replacing what was broken in the beginning. I purchased a 30 dollar fine tipped stylus at Target, and it’s working just fine. Plus, I don’t have to worry about it glitching.",,
"Not sure why my pencil started acting up recently. When I first started using it a few weeks ago, it worked flawlessly. Last week when I was using it to do a presentation, it disconnected and I had to repair it to my ipad. Not a big deal since it only happened once during my presentation. Fast forward to this past weekend when I was drawing up another presentation for this week, it started disconnecting again. Im not sure if its just a software glitch but its highly frustrating when youre so far along and it stops working. Pairing is easy but its just inconvenient",,
I have been writing with this for about a week and it is already malfunctioning. It will only write if you hold it on a specific angle. This is junk! I already threw away all the packaging but I am going to try and get this replaced through Apple or amazon. It's brand new and already won't work right. I've never dropped it or got it wet.,,
"paired my ipad pro with this apple pencil.The design for the apple pencil is elegant, love the design.However it is extremely difficult to write on my ipad pro, feel like it is different from regular pen.",,
"Not overly impressed with this product. I have tried to set my iPad to the proper settings to use it, but don’t seem to get much response from it when I want to write something.",,
HAVE TO HAVE IPAD PRO,,
"The item itself looked fine.  Didn't seem damaged, but the Apple Pencil, which was purchased from Amazon.com Services LLC, was already unwrapped when it arrived.  This was sold as new, so we didn't want to take for granted that it would continue to be okay, or would hold up to a warranty.  Apple was called, and they confirmed that it was not packed the way it should have been.  We don't know if it was actually used, and if used, how long it had already been used, or maybe someone just didn't want it and returned it after trying it.  We don't know if it came that way from the apple store, or if it may have been unwrapped at the distribution center.  We returned the item, and, instead, bought directly from the apple store.  That item came packed new.",,
"Good, but too expensive",,
Make sure to check return policy before purchasing! It doesnt work with all ipads. I requested return but it denied. I bought it for my daughter but it didnt work with her i pad.,,
"I did EVERYTHING I was supposed to and this Owen has never, not once worked and now it’s too late to get refund 😡😡😡",,
Only Apple can sell a PENCIL for $110.00 USD...!!!,,
Incomplete product,,
Constantly wrong. Cannot keep a good flow of thought since this pencil is constantly wrong,,
It worked great. I’ve always kept it on my iPad. Maybe that why it quit. I’ve never dropped it. It just wouldn’t work one day when I went to use it.,,
"And it came broken in half… idk what’s going on at the warehouse there, but it must have gotten swapped or not observed. How does a broken in half pencil get sent to a customer??",,
"I like the apple pencil. I've tried several different third party ones and this definitely works the best with iOS devices. The apple pencil feels like writing with a big plastic pencil on a window. It's also obnoxiously loud whenever you press down on the screen. If you're in a quiet room, people are going to hear you writing with this thing, which I find mildly annoying in meetings and such. I love my new iPad but I still think the S Pens on my older Samsung tablets had a more natural feel overall & were better for drawing. Good for light sketching and notes, would recommend getting a separate (non iPad) drawing tablet for professional artists. It's ridiculously overpriced for what it is, considering other manufacturers include pressure sensitive styluses that work better than this at no additional cost with their tablets. Again, still the best for ipad, but not great.",,
I bought 3 apple pencils for myself and my sister and brother but I was very disappointed that the touch from the pen was not what I expected I thought it would have been better touch when I try writing on my phone but I just was not satisfied with it,,
I was obviously sent a VERY used item despite paying full price for a brand new 2nd gen Apple Pencil! The craziest part is the box was wrapped up in the plastic as if it were brand new (as shown in the photos). Upon opening it up I noticed that something was off about the case. I removed the manual that comes with it and saw a pencil that was way too big to fit in the box. I contacted amazon and will be returning this junk. I am livid that they allowed this to get past their inspection. I will never buy an apple product off Amazon again,,
"It came quickly and everything was there. My issue is, I’ve had it charging ALLLLL day and it’s still not connecting or even registering.I’ve watched every video, read every tutorial and yet nothing it working, registering or connecting. Im a bit frustrated because it took me awhile to even decide to take the plunge and spend this much for a “stylus” and highly anticipated it’s arrival.",,
Did not work for iPad 9th generation. Works with 1st generation pencil.,,
